### Aflatoxin Poisoning (Aflatoxicosis)

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef15`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** aflatoxicosis, aflatoxin poisoning, aflatoxin B1 poisoning, AFB1 toxicosis, Aspergillus poisoning, Aspergillus toxicosis, contaminated pet food, contaminated dog food, dog food poisoning, pet food poisoning, pet food recall, foodborne mycotoxicosis, corn toxicosis, moldy corn poisoning, peanut poisoning, grain toxicosis, mycotoxicosis, hepatotoxic mycotoxin

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | Dogs are among the MOST SUSCEPTIBLE species due to low liver glutathione levels. Young dogs more vulnerable than adults. Has caused numerous deaths from contaminated pet food. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY. |
| Cats | HIGH | Cats are highly resistant to acute aflatoxicosis but susceptible to chronic exposure over time. Less commonly affected than dogs. |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds are extremely susceptible to aflatoxins. Aflatoxin was first discovered after approximately 100,000 turkey poults died from contaminated peanut meal in 1960 ('Turkey X disease'). Ducklings and young turkeys are most vulnerable, but all bird species are at risk. Aflatoxins cause severe liver damage, immunosuppression, and neurological symptoms in birds. Pet birds may be exposed through contaminated seeds, corn, or peanuts in their diet. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Rabbits and guinea pigs are highly sensitive to aflatoxin B1. Studies show these species are more susceptible than mice, hamsters, and rats. Aflatoxins cause hepatotoxicity (liver damage), immunosuppression, and can be fatal. Small mammals may be exposed through contaminated hay, grains, or commercial pellets containing corn or peanut products. Young animals are more vulnerable than adults. |
| Reptiles | HIGH | No animal species is known to be immune to the acute toxic effects of aflatoxins. Reptiles may be exposed through contaminated feeder insects (crickets, mealworms) raised on moldy grainâthis exposure route has been suspected in chameleon deaths. Carnivorous reptiles consuming whole prey should have lower risk. Limited direct research exists, but hepatotoxicity would be expected based on the known mechanism of aflatoxin toxicity in other vertebrates. |

### Alcohol

**UUID:** `63f63b3a-1172-4fb2-9702-45496c99df4d`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

*(Also in: Recreational Substances)*

**Alternate Names:** ethanol, ethyl alcohol, beer, wine, liquor, spirits, vodka, whiskey, rum, cocktail, isopropanol, isopropyl alcohol, rubbing alcohol, methanol, methyl alcohol, wood alcohol, hand sanitizer

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs are highly susceptible; even small amounts can cause signs of inebriation |
| Cats | SEVERE | Cats are especially sensitive to alcohol; smaller body size increases risk |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds are highly sensitive due to small body size and rapid metabolism |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Rabbits, guinea pigs, and ferrets lack efficient alcohol metabolism. Guinea pigs have genetically lost the ADH7 enzyme for ethanol processing. Ferrets are extremely sensitive and can absorb alcohol through their skin. Small body size means rapid intoxication from even tiny amounts. Do not allow any alcohol exposure. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Ethanol causes CNS depression in reptiles and can lead to dehydration and organ damage. A study in bearded dragons showed significant metabolic and body temperature changes from ethanol exposure. Isopropyl alcohol can cause chemical burns and systemic toxicity through skin absorption. Limited research but avoid all exposure. |

### Avocado

**UUID:** `6a0dda24-d0e1-47c4-af59-068101844c8b`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

*(Also in: Plants)*

**Alternate Names:** guacamole, avocado pit, avocado seed, avocado leaves, persea americana

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | LOW | Dogs are relatively resistant to persin; main risks are pancreatitis from high fat content and GI obstruction from swallowing the pit |
| Cats | LOW | Cats are relatively resistant to persin; may experience mild GI upset |
| Birds | SEVERE | Avocado is extremely toxic to birds. Persin, a fungicidal toxin found in all parts of the avocado, causes myocardial necrosis (heart muscle death) in birds. Lethal doses are as low as 2 grams in canaries and 3.5 grams in budgerigars. Death typically occurs within 24-47 hours of ingestion. Signs include lethargy, respiratory distress, weakness, and sudden death. There is no antidote. Never feed any part of avocado to birds. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Rabbits, guinea pigs, and other small mammals are highly susceptible to persin toxicity. Documented cases of rabbit deaths have occurred within 30 hours of ingesting avocado leaves. Persin causes myocardial necrosis and congestive heart failure. All parts of the avocado plant (fruit, leaves, bark, pit) are toxic. Never feed avocado to small mammals. |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Avocado is toxic to tortoises and other reptiles. The Tortoise Table lists avocado as dangerous for tortoises. Persin can cause fluid accumulation around the heart, tissue damage to organs, and potentially death. While less data exists for reptiles than birds or mammals, the conserved cardiac toxicity mechanism warrants avoiding all exposure. |

### Black Walnuts

**UUID:** `6349efb2-07ef-4da1-a8cc-bbd6dc338f77`

**Entry Severity:** HIGH

*(Also in: Plants)*

**Alternate Names:** black walnut tree, Juglans nigra, black walnut wood, black walnut shavings, walnut hulls, black walnut sawdust, juglone, walnut shells

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs are commonly affected; neurologic signs are 4x more likely with wood/shavings than with nuts/hulls; Labrador retrievers and golden retrievers overrepresented in case reports |
| Cats | LOW | Limited data; cats less commonly exposed due to feeding habits |
| Birds | LOW | Black walnut nuts (kernels only) are generally considered safe treats for parrots when fresh and uncontaminated. However, black walnut WOOD and shavings should be avoided due to juglone content. The primary toxicity concerns for dogs (tremorgenic mycotoxins from mold) do not appear to significantly affect birds. Only offer fresh, uncontaminated nut meat in moderation; never use black walnut wood for perches or cage materials. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Black walnuts are dangerous to rabbits and potentially other small mammals. The husks are specifically toxic, and the plant contains tannins that negatively affect rabbits. The high fat content can cause fatal digestive issues including GI stasis and fatty liver disease in rabbits, who are hindgut fermenters designed for high-fiber, low-fat diets. Moldy husks can also contain potent neurotoxins. Do not feed any part of a black walnut tree to rabbits or other small mammals. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Black walnuts contain juglone, a compound toxic to reptiles that can cause respiratory distress and allergic reactions. Black walnut wood, shavings, and bark should NEVER be used in reptile enclosures as substrate or decoration. While documented fatal cases in reptiles are limited, the high juglone concentrations make black walnut dangerous. Safe alternatives include oak or cork. The nuts themselves pose less risk than wood products, but are not recommended. |

### Caffeine

**UUID:** `ae80bf97-0ffd-4ed8-b9d9-727e747d583b`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** coffee, coffee beans, coffee grounds, espresso, tea, tea bags, green tea, black tea, energy drinks, Red Bull, Monster, soda, cola, diet pills, caffeine pills, NoDoz, Vivarin, pre-workout, guarana

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs are more sensitive to caffeine than humans; coffee grounds and caffeine pills pose the greatest risk |
| Cats | SEVERE | Cats are highly sensitive to caffeine and cannot metabolize it effectively; even small amounts can cause serious toxicity |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds are extremely sensitive to caffeine due to their high metabolic rate and small body size. A 2022 study in pigeons documented rapid onset of neurological and cardiac symptoms. Documented parrot deaths from chocolate (which contains caffeine and theobromine) confirm methylxanthine toxicity is fatal. Coffee, tea, energy drinks, and caffeine pills pose severe risks. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Ferrets are especially sensitive to caffeineâeven a few sips can be dangerous. Rabbits, guinea pigs, and other small mammals are also vulnerable due to their small body size and different metabolism. Caffeine causes cardiac stimulation, tremors, and seizures. Keep all caffeinated products away from small pets. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Limited specific research on caffeine toxicity in reptiles, but as a CNS stimulant, caffeine would affect reptile nervous systems. Reptiles are unlikely to consume caffeinated beverages voluntarily, but any exposure should be treated seriously. Coffee grounds, tea bags, and caffeine pills should be kept away from reptile enclosures. |

### Chocolate

**UUID:** `d8c34930-fe78-414c-a182-49521dbfc266`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

*(Also in: Holiday Hazards)*

**Alternate Names:** cocoa, cacao, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, baking chocolate, white chocolate, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, brownie, brownies, fudge, hot cocoa, hot chocolate, chocolate cake, chocolate bar, choclate, coco

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs are commonly affected due to indiscriminate eating habits. Hospitalization is often required for treatment. |
| Cats | SEVERE | Cats are more sensitive to methylxanthines than dogs, though they rarely consume chocolate voluntarily. |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds are extremely sensitive to theobromine and caffeine due to their fast metabolism and small body size. Even tiny amounts of chocolate can be fatal. Documented deaths in parrots and mynah birds from small quantities of dark chocolate. Causes cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and acute liver/kidney damage. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, and other small mammals cannot efficiently metabolize theobromine. Even small amounts can cause digestive issues, cardiac problems, and potentially death. Keep all chocolate products away from small pets. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Limited data available. Reptiles are unlikely to consume chocolate voluntarily due to dietary preferences, but the methylxanthines in chocolate could potentially affect them if ingested. Avoid exposure as a precaution. |

### Cooked Bones

**UUID:** `59cf7dc4-5d83-4811-97f1-ce1d0162cd28`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Informational)*

**Alternate Names:** chicken bones, turkey bones, pork bones, beef bones cooked, rib bones, poultry bones, fish bones, lamb bones cooked, ham bones, steak bones, pork chop bones, t-bone, drumstick bones, wing bones, spare ribs, rotisserie chicken bones, turkey carcass, wishbone, bone splinters, bone fragments

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs commonly chew and swallow bone fragments; larger pieces pose obstruction risk, smaller splinters pose perforation risk |
| Cats | MODERATE | Cats may chew on smaller bones like fish or poultry; fish bones are particularly hazardous due to their thin, sharp structure |
| Birds | LOW | Pet birds (budgies, parrots, canaries) do not naturally consume bones. Raptors and wild birds of prey can digest RAW bones using highly acidic stomachs, but cooked bone exposure is extremely unlikely in pet bird species. If a pet bird somehow ingested cooked bone fragments, obstruction or injury would be possible but this scenario is uncommon. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Ferrets (obligate carnivores) can safely consume RAW bones as part of a whole-prey diet, but cooked bones become brittle and can splinter, posing obstruction and perforation risks. Herbivorous small mammals (rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, chinchillas) do not consume bones and would not typically be exposed. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Carnivorous reptiles (snakes, monitor lizards) regularly swallow whole prey including bones, which they digest completely using highly acidic stomachs. However, their natural diet consists of RAW bonesâcooked bones are not part of any reptile's normal diet, and the scenario of a pet reptile encountering cooked bones is extremely unlikely. |

### Fatty Foods & Grease

**UUID:** `2e094121-64ea-499c-bfb4-6db98f139b55`

**Entry Severity:** LOW-MODERATE

*(Also in: Holiday Hazards)*

**Alternate Names:** fat trimmings, grease, bacon grease, meat drippings, turkey skin, chicken skin, gravy, fried foods, greasy foods, table scraps, lard, cooking oil, butter, bacon, pork fat, beef fat, schmaltz, duck fat

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Dogs are commonly affected; miniature schnauzers, Yorkshire terriers, cocker spaniels, and poodles are at higher risk; overweight and older dogs also more susceptible |
| Cats | LOW | Cats are less commonly affected by diet-induced pancreatitis; feline pancreatitis often occurs spontaneously or with other conditions like inflammatory bowel disease |
| Birds | MODERATE | High-fat diets can cause serious health problems in birds including hepatic lipidosis (fatty liver disease), atherosclerosis (fat deposits in arteries), obesity, and heart disease. Amazon parrots and Quaker parrots are particularly prone to high cholesterol. Overindulgence in high-fat foods like peanut butter, cheese, or fatty seeds contributes to these conditions. Limit fatty treats and prioritize a balanced pellet-based diet. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Rabbits, guinea pigs, and chinchillas require high-fiber, low-fat diets. High-fat foods can cause life-threatening GI stasis (gut slowdown), hepatic lipidosis (fatty liver disease), obesity, and digestive upset. These herbivores cannot properly process fatty foods. Even small amounts of greasy table scraps can be dangerous. Never feed fatty foods, nuts, or seeds in significant amounts to small herbivorous mammals. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Fatty foods are not a natural part of most reptile diets. While not acutely toxic, high-fat foods are inappropriate and can contribute to obesity in captive reptiles if fed regularly. Herbivorous reptiles like iguanas and tortoises should never be offered fatty human foods. Carnivorous reptiles may occasionally consume prey with higher fat content naturally. Overall risk is low due to dietary incompatibility. |

### Fruit Pits & Seeds

**UUID:** `f1369ae0-b97d-424d-98b7-b46a9b245109`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Informational)*

**Alternate Names:** apple seeds, apple core, cherry pits, cherry seeds, peach pits, peach seeds, apricot pits, apricot seeds, plum pits, plum seeds, nectarine pits, stone fruit pits, cyanogenic glycosides, amygdalin

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Obstruction is the primary concern, especially in smaller dogs; cyanide poisoning is rare unless large quantities of seeds are thoroughly crushed and consumed |
| Cats | LOW | Cats are very unlikely to consume enough pits or seeds to cause cyanide toxicity; leaves may cause hypersalivation from natural resins |
| Birds | MODERATE | Apple seeds, cherry pits, and stone fruit pits (peach, plum, apricot, nectarine) contain cyanogenic glycosides that release hydrogen cyanide when crushed or chewed. Birds are highly susceptible due to their small body size and fast metabolism. Even a few crushed apple seeds could potentially harm small birds like budgies or canaries. Always remove all seeds and pits from fruit before offering to pet birdsâthe fruit flesh is safe. |
| Small Mammals | LOW | Herbivorous small mammals (rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters) do not typically consume hard fruit pits or seeds. If somehow chewed, the cyanogenic glycosides would pose a theoretical risk, but this exposure scenario is uncommon in practice. Carnivorous small mammals (ferrets) would not consume fruit pits. Primary concern would be accidental access to fruit scraps containing pits. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Fruit pits and seeds are not part of any reptile's natural diet. Carnivorous reptiles eat animal prey, while herbivorous reptiles (tortoises, iguanas) eat leaves, flowers, and soft fruitsânot hard pits. The risk of a pet reptile encountering and consuming fruit pits is extremely low. Cyanogenic glycosides would theoretically be harmful if ingested, but this scenario is highly unlikely. |

### Garlic

**UUID:** `dad777ea-3120-43b1-9b8f-aee413716abc`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** garlic cloves, garlic powder, garlic salt, minced garlic, roasted garlic, garlic supplements, Allium sativum

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | 3-5 times more toxic than onion. Japanese breeds (Akita, Shiba Inu, Shikoku, Kai Ken, Japanese Terrier, Tosa, Japanese Spitz, Hokkaido) are at increased risk. |
| Cats | SEVERE | Cats are more susceptible than dogs and can develop toxicosis from very small amounts. Any exposure is potentially dangerous. |
| Birds | HIGH | Garlic and all Allium family plants are toxic to birds. A documented case describes a Dusky-headed conure that died after being force-fed garlic, with necropsy confirming hemolytic anemia. The sulfur compounds in garlic cause destruction of red blood cells. Garlic is approximately 3-5 times more toxic than onions. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Garlic is toxic to rabbits, guinea pigs, and other small mammals. Contains thiosulphate and other sulfur compounds that cause hemolytic anemia. Garlic has immunosuppressive effects in rabbits and can cause anaphylactic reactions. Never feed garlic or garlic-containing supplements to small mammals. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Limited data available. Reptiles are unlikely to consume garlic due to dietary preferences. While the hemolytic effects seen in mammals and birds could theoretically affect reptiles, no documented cases exist. Avoid exposure as a precaution. |

### Grapes & Raisins

**UUID:** `d1bde5cd-6881-4765-ac4c-b9f43b40da70`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** grapes, raisins, currants, sultanas, Zante currants, dried grapes, Corinthian raisins, Vitis vinifera, grape poisoning, raisin toxicity, trail mix, raisin bran, grape juice, muscadine

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | Unpredictable toxicity â any amount should be considered dangerous. Hospitalization is typically recommended. |
| Cats | LOW | Rare anecdotal reports exist, but in one study of 13 cats with known ingestion, none developed kidney injury. |
| Birds | LOW | The tartaric acid kidney toxicity seen in dogs does not appear to affect birds. Grapes are commonly offered as treats to pet birds without reported toxicity. The primary concern is sugar content with excessive feeding. Consult an avian veterinarian for species-specific dietary guidance. |
| Small Mammals | LOW | The tartaric acid kidney toxicity seen in dogs has not been documented in small mammals. Guinea pigs and rabbits may encounter grapes without the same kidney injury risk, but the high sugar content can cause digestive upset and obesity. Raisins should be avoided due to concentrated sugar content. Consult an exotics veterinarian for species-specific dietary guidance. |
| Reptiles | LOW | No documented toxicity in reptiles. Some herbivorous reptiles like tortoises may eat grapes as occasional fruit treats. The tartaric acid sensitivity appears specific to dogs. As with any fruit, offer only occasionally due to sugar content. |

### Hops

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef14`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

*(Also in: Household Items, Plants)*

**Alternate Names:** beer hops, brewing hops, hop cones, hop flowers, hop plugs, spent hops, lupulin, home brewing hops, homebrew hops, wort hops, dried hops, pellet hops, Humulus lupulus, Humulus

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Causes malignant hyperthermia with body temperature exceeding 109Â°F. Death can occur within 3 HOURS without treatment. Large breeds may be overrepresented but ANY dog is at risk. THIS IS AN EMERGENCYâseek immediate veterinary care. |
| Cats | LOW | Hops toxicosis has NOT been reported in cats. However, given the extreme severity in dogs, cats should also be prevented from accessing hops. |
| Birds | LOW | The malignant hyperthermia reaction from hops appears to be specific to dogs; there are no documented cases of hops toxicity in birds; small amounts of hop extract are actually used in some avian calming supplements |
| Small Mammals | LOW | Hops toxicosis has only been documented in dogs (and rarely cats); no cases have been reported in rabbits, guinea pigs, or other small mammals; hop extracts in small doses are used in some small animal calming formulations |
| Reptiles | LOW | No documented cases of hops toxicity in reptiles; the malignant hyperthermia-like reaction appears to be mammal-specific and primarily affects dogs; reptiles are unlikely to consume hops but should still be kept away as a precaution |

### Macadamia Nuts

**UUID:** `df7f2d18-6f6c-40c8-9f77-cdfbc815e946`

**Entry Severity:** MODERATE

**Alternate Names:** macadamia, Australia nut, Queensland nut, macadamia integrifolia, macadamia tetraphylla

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Dogs are the only species in which toxicity has been documented; symptoms typically resolve within 24-48 hours but veterinary guidance is recommended |
| Cats | MODERATE | While macadamia nut toxicity is most well-documented in dogs, cats can also be affected. Symptoms may include lethargy, vomiting, ataxia (wobbly gait), tremors, and weakness. The high fat content can also cause pancreatitis. Veterinarians recommend avoiding macadamia nuts in cats entirely. |
| Birds | LOW | Macadamia nuts are generally considered safe for parrots and other pet birds. They are commonly recommended as occasional treats for macaws and large parrots. The toxicity seen in dogs and cats has not been documented in birds. Offer only unsalted, raw macadamia nuts in moderation due to high fat content. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | While the specific macadamia toxicity seen in dogs has not been documented in small mammals, nuts in general should NOT be fed to rabbits and other small mammals. Nuts are too high in fat for their digestive systems, which require high fiber and low fat. Can cause GI stasis, obesity, fatty liver disease, and other serious health problems. Avoid all nuts. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Macadamia nut toxicity appears to be primarily a concern for dogs and cats. No toxicity has been documented in reptiles. Nuts are not a natural part of most reptile diets, so accidental ingestion is unlikely. Not recommended as food due to dietary incompatibility. |

### Milk & Dairy Products

**UUID:** `9bc97e12-961b-4fee-adee-182c55d91ea9`

**Entry Severity:** LOW

**Alternate Names:** milk, cow's milk, cheese, ice cream, yogurt, cream, butter, cottage cheese, sour cream, whipped cream, half and half, lactose, dairy, cheddar, mozzarella, parmesan, cream cheese, whole milk, skim milk

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | LOW | Many dogs are lactose intolerant but some retain the ability to digest dairy; high-fat dairy poses additional pancreatitis risk |
| Cats | LOW | Cats are more likely to be lactose intolerant than dogs; despite popular belief, milk is not recommended for cats |
| Birds | LOW | Birds lack the lactase enzyme needed to digest lactose, making them lactose intolerant. They never encounter dairy products in nature. Ingestion may cause diarrhea but is not typically dangerous. There is no nutritional benefit to feeding dairy to birds. Aged cheeses contain less lactose and may be tolerated in tiny amounts as an occasional treat. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Rabbits, guinea pigs, and chinchillas are strictly lactose intolerant. Adult rabbits lack the lactase enzyme, and dairy can cause severe GI upset, diarrhea, and potentially life-threatening GI stasis. Because rabbits cannot vomit, GI disturbances can quickly become serious. Ferrets may tolerate very small amounts but still lack sufficient lactase for significant dairy consumption. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Dairy products are completely foreign to reptile physiology and are not part of any reptile's natural diet. There is limited research on reptile lactose tolerance. Incidental exposure is unlikely to cause serious harm but may cause digestive upset. Dairy should simply be avoided entirely for all reptile species. |

### Moldy Foods

**UUID:** `beacabe2-00ab-4e59-8c8c-c09665f940b6`

**Entry Severity:** HIGH

**Alternate Names:** moldy bread, moldy cheese, spoiled food, rotten food, compost, garbage, trash, mycotoxins, tremorgenic mycotoxins, moldy walnuts, moldy nuts, penitrem-A, roquefortine

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs are most commonly affected due to scavenging behavior; roaming dogs and those with access to garbage or compost are at highest risk |
| Cats | LOW | Tremorgenic mycotoxicosis has NOT been reported in domestic cats, likely due to their more selective eating habits. However, cats should still be prevented from accessing moldy foods as a precaution. |
| Birds | HIGH | Birds may be MORE sensitive to mycotoxins than mammals due to their high metabolic rate and unique physiology. Tremorgenic mycotoxins can cause neurological symptoms including tremors, incoordination, and seizures. Mycotoxins are also very damaging to birds' livers. Common contaminated foods include peanuts, sunflower seeds, corn, and breadâall frequently fed to pet birds. Seed mixes may be contaminated if they contain peanuts, sunflower seeds, or corn. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Small mammals are susceptible to tremorgenic mycotoxins through the same mechanisms as dogs and cats. Rabbits and guinea pigs may encounter moldy hay, vegetables, or treats. Signs would include tremors, incoordination, and neurological symptoms. Any food showing visible mold should be discarded immediately. Store hay and food in cool, dry conditions to prevent mold growth. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Limited direct research exists on tremorgenic mycotoxicosis in reptiles. All vertebrates appear susceptible to mycotoxins, and reptiles would likely be affected through contaminated food items. Herbivorous reptiles could encounter moldy produce, while carnivorous reptiles could theoretically be exposed through contaminated feeder insects raised on moldy grain. Practical exposure is less common than in mammals. |

### Nutmeg

**UUID:** `d6ac2e8a-00de-42cb-9c6b-f912ec43d5f3`

**Entry Severity:** MODERATE

*(Also in: Holiday Hazards)*

**Alternate Names:** ground nutmeg, whole nutmeg, nutmeg seed, myristica fragrans, myristicin

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Large amounts can cause hallucinogenic and cardiovascular effects; culinary amounts in baked goods are generally not a serious concern |
| Cats | MODERATE | Cats are also susceptible to myristicin; similar effects expected at high doses |
| Birds | MODERATE | Limited safety data for birds and spices. Myristicin acts as a central nervous system depressant and can cause disorientation, sedation, and potentially more serious effects. World Parrot Trust recommends avoiding nutmeg and other spices in birds due to insufficient safety studies. Keep spices away from bird-accessible areas. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Laboratory studies have documented hepatotoxicity (liver damage) and death in rabbits and guinea pigs given myristicin. CNS effects including hyperactivity followed by sedation have been observed in guinea pigs. While culinary amounts are unlikely to cause serious harm, large ingestions should be treated as potentially dangerous. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Nutmeg and spices are not part of any reptile's natural diet. Accidental exposure is unlikely, and no specific toxicity data exists for reptiles. If ingestion occurs, monitor for GI upset and CNS signs. Not a significant concern due to dietary incompatibility. |

### Onions

**UUID:** `8a27c390-254f-47c9-90e7-7739694f603f`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** onion, red onion, white onion, yellow onion, green onion, scallions, shallots, chives, leeks, onion powder, onion flakes, dried onion, dehydrated onion, Allium cepa, Allium porrum, Allium schoenoprasum

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Japanese breeds (Akita, Shiba Inu, Shikoku, Kai Ken, Japanese Terrier, Tosa, Japanese Spitz, Hokkaido) are at increased risk due to a hereditary red blood cell condition. |
| Cats | SEVERE | Cats are more susceptible than dogs. Heinz body anemia can occur with very small amounts. Caution with baby foods that may contain onion powder. |
| Birds | HIGH | All Allium family plants (onions, garlic, leeks, chives) are toxic to birds. Onions have caused deaths in geese and other bird species. The sulfur compounds cause hemolytic anemiaâdestruction of red blood cellsâleading to weakness, respiratory distress, and potentially death. Even small amounts relative to body weight can cause toxicity. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Onions are highly toxic to rabbits, guinea pigs, and other small mammals. The bulbs contain compounds that cause hemolytic anemia, destroying red blood cells. Can cause severe illness, anemia, and death. Never feed any part of onions or other Allium plants to small mammals. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Limited data available. Reptiles are unlikely to consume onions due to dietary preferences. The hemolytic effects documented in mammals and birds have not been studied in reptiles. Avoid exposure as a precaution, but accidental exposure is unlikely to occur. |

### Raw Yeast Dough

**UUID:** `ec90eb4b-765b-45cb-9255-f449b656b7d3`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

*(Also in: Holiday Hazards)*

**Alternate Names:** bread dough, raw bread dough, unbaked dough, rising dough, pizza dough, raw pizza dough, sourdough starter, yeast dough, uncooked dough

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | Dogs are most commonly affected; deep-chested breeds face additional GDV risk from stomach distention |
| Cats | SEVERE | Cats are also at risk for both bloating and alcohol poisoning from raw dough |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds are highly susceptible due to their warm body temperature (which promotes rapid yeast fermentation), small body size (meaning ethanol affects them quickly), and inability to vomit effectively. The combination of gastric distension and alcohol production is life-threatening. Never allow birds access to rising dough. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Rabbits, guinea pigs, and ferrets cannot vomit, making raw yeast dough extremely dangerous. Once consumed, the dough cannot be expelled and will continue fermenting. Small body size means both the gastric distension and ethanol production are life-threatening. Ferrets are especially sensitive to alcohol toxicity. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Reptiles have lower body temperatures which may slow yeast fermentation, but the mechanism of ethanol production would still occur if dough is consumed. Reptiles are unlikely to consume bread dough voluntarily due to dietary preferences, but any ingestion should be treated as potentially serious due to alcohol toxicity. |

### Salt

**UUID:** `c9fb21d1-a66a-418e-a63f-1b754ec048f2`

**Entry Severity:** HIGH

*(Also in: Garage & Garden)*

**Alternate Names:** sodium chloride, table salt, rock salt, de-icing salt, road salt, sea salt, homemade play dough, salt dough, playdough, paint balls, sea water, ocean water, salty snacks, ice melt, ice melter, ice melt pellets, de-icer, deicer, sidewalk salt, driveway salt, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, Safe Paw, Safe Step, Morton Safe-T-Salt, Road Runner ice melt, pet safe ice melt, pet friendly ice melt

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs are frequently affected due to eating play dough, de-icing salt, or drinking sea water at the beach |
| Cats | HIGH | Cats can develop toxicity from ocean water exposure or licking salt from surfaces |
| Birds | HIGH | Birds are also susceptible to salt toxicity |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Salt toxicity has been documented in pet rabbits. A 2020 case report in the Journal of Exotic Pet Medicine documented the first clinical case of sodium chloride toxicosis in a pet rabbit from a Himalayan salt lickâthe rabbit developed seizures, ataxia, and obtunded mentation. Guinea pigs are also at risk, and excess salt/minerals can contribute to bladder sludge and urinary stones. Never provide salt licks to rabbits or guinea pigs. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Many reptiles (iguanas, chameleons, desert species) have specialized nasal salt glands that help excrete excess sodium, providing some protection. However, reptile kidneys are less efficient than mammalian kidneys at handling sodium loads. Excessive salt intake should be avoided. Common pet reptiles should not be fed salty foods or exposed to salt products. |

**Alternate Names:** tomato plant, tomato leaves, tomato stems, green tomatoes, unripe tomatoes, cherry tomato plant, Solanum, Solanum lycopersicum, potato plant, potato leaves, potato stems, green potatoes, raw potatoes, potato skins, Solanum tuberosum, nightshade family, Solanaceae, solanine, tomatine, glycoalkaloids

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Most cases cause only GI upset; severe toxicity requires ingestion of large amounts of green plant material; puppies and small dogs are at higher risk; documented cases of seizures exist with significant green tomato ingestion |
| Cats | MODERATE | Cats are susceptible but rarely consume enough plant material to cause severe toxicity; same clinical signs as dogs expected |
| Birds | MODERATE | Birds may be affected; small body size increases risk from smaller exposures |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | The leaves, stems, and green parts of tomato and potato plants contain glycoalkaloids (solanine and tomatine) that are toxic to rabbits, guinea pigs, and other small mammals. Green potatoes and sprouts are especially dangerous. Can cause digestive upset, decreased appetite, lethargy, abdominal pain, and in severe cases neurological symptoms. |
| Reptiles | HIGH | All parts of the potato plant are highly toxic to tortoises, whether raw or cooked. The glycoalkaloids solanine and chaconine can cause neurological and digestive issues. In large amounts, these compounds can be fatal to tortoises. Tomato plant leaves and stems are also toxic. Contact a veterinarian immediately if ingestion is suspected. |

### Xylitol

**UUID:** `d7723ed0-6496-40b3-8b1c-84e129083cb9`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** birch sugar, wood sugar, birch bark extract, sugar alcohol, E967, sugar-free gum, sugar-free candy, sugar-free peanut butter, sugar-free mints, xylitol gum, xylitol poisoning, zylatol, xilitol

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | Even small amounts can be life-threatening. Individual response varies. Hospitalization is typically recommended. |
| Cats | LOW | Cats do not appear to develop hypoglycemia or liver injury from xylitol based on available studies. |
| Birds | HIGH | Birds have fast metabolisms that may make them sensitive to xylitol's effects. A documented case of fatal xylitol toxicosis occurred in wild Cape sugarbirds that consumed xylitol nectar solution. While data in pet birds is limited, the potential for rapid blood sugar changes makes xylitol dangerous. Avoid all xylitol-containing products around birds. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Rabbits have demonstrated sensitivity to xylitol, experiencing effects similar to dogs. Ferrets, hamsters, and guinea pigs may also be affected, though published data is limited. Given the documented sensitivity in rabbits and the severity of effects in dogs, avoid all xylitol exposure in small mammals. |
| Reptiles | LOW | No documented cases of xylitol toxicity in reptiles. Reptiles have very different glucose metabolism than mammals and are unlikely to experience the insulin surge that causes hypoglycemia in dogs. However, data is extremely limited. Avoid exposure as a precaution. |

### Avocado

**UUID:** `6a0dda24-d0e1-47c4-af59-068101844c8b`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

*(Also in: Foods)*

**Alternate Names:** guacamole, avocado pit, avocado seed, avocado leaves, persea americana

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | LOW | Dogs are relatively resistant to persin; main risks are pancreatitis from high fat content and GI obstruction from swallowing the pit |
| Cats | LOW | Cats are relatively resistant to persin; may experience mild GI upset |
| Birds | SEVERE | Avocado is extremely toxic to birds. Persin, a fungicidal toxin found in all parts of the avocado, causes myocardial necrosis (heart muscle death) in birds. Lethal doses are as low as 2 grams in canaries and 3.5 grams in budgerigars. Death typically occurs within 24-47 hours of ingestion. Signs include lethargy, respiratory distress, weakness, and sudden death. There is no antidote. Never feed any part of avocado to birds. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Rabbits, guinea pigs, and other small mammals are highly susceptible to persin toxicity. Documented cases of rabbit deaths have occurred within 30 hours of ingesting avocado leaves. Persin causes myocardial necrosis and congestive heart failure. All parts of the avocado plant (fruit, leaves, bark, pit) are toxic. Never feed avocado to small mammals. |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Avocado is toxic to tortoises and other reptiles. The Tortoise Table lists avocado as dangerous for tortoises. Persin can cause fluid accumulation around the heart, tissue damage to organs, and potentially death. While less data exists for reptiles than birds or mammals, the conserved cardiac toxicity mechanism warrants avoiding all exposure. |

### Black Walnuts

**UUID:** `6349efb2-07ef-4da1-a8cc-bbd6dc338f77`

**Entry Severity:** HIGH

*(Also in: Foods)*

**Alternate Names:** black walnut tree, Juglans nigra, black walnut wood, black walnut shavings, walnut hulls, black walnut sawdust, juglone, walnut shells

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs are commonly affected; neurologic signs are 4x more likely with wood/shavings than with nuts/hulls; Labrador retrievers and golden retrievers overrepresented in case reports |
| Cats | LOW | Limited data; cats less commonly exposed due to feeding habits |
| Birds | LOW | Black walnut nuts (kernels only) are generally considered safe treats for parrots when fresh and uncontaminated. However, black walnut WOOD and shavings should be avoided due to juglone content. The primary toxicity concerns for dogs (tremorgenic mycotoxins from mold) do not appear to significantly affect birds. Only offer fresh, uncontaminated nut meat in moderation; never use black walnut wood for perches or cage materials. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Black walnuts are dangerous to rabbits and potentially other small mammals. The husks are specifically toxic, and the plant contains tannins that negatively affect rabbits. The high fat content can cause fatal digestive issues including GI stasis and fatty liver disease in rabbits, who are hindgut fermenters designed for high-fiber, low-fat diets. Moldy husks can also contain potent neurotoxins. Do not feed any part of a black walnut tree to rabbits or other small mammals. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Black walnuts contain juglone, a compound toxic to reptiles that can cause respiratory distress and allergic reactions. Black walnut wood, shavings, and bark should NEVER be used in reptile enclosures as substrate or decoration. While documented fatal cases in reptiles are limited, the high juglone concentrations make black walnut dangerous. Safe alternatives include oak or cork. The nuts themselves pose less risk than wood products, but are not recommended. |

**Entry Severity:** MODERATE

**Alternate Names:** Buxus, Buxus sempervirens, Buxus microphylla, Buxus sinica, box tree, box hedge, boxwood hedge, boxwood shrub, common boxwood, American boxwood, English boxwood, Japanese boxwood, Korean boxwood, dwarf boxwood, littleleaf boxwood, Buxaceae

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | The bitter taste usually prevents significant ingestion. Most cases involve only vomiting and diarrhea. However, the steroidal alkaloids can cause neurological and cardiovascular effects with larger ingestions. Puppies and small dogs are at higher risk. Contact your veterinarian if your dog has eaten any part of a boxwood plant. |
| Cats | MODERATE | Cats rarely eat boxwood, but the steroidal alkaloids pose the same risks as for dogs. Any ingestion should be reported to a veterinarian due to the potential for neurological effects. |
| Birds | HIGH | Birds are highly susceptible to the steroidal alkaloids in boxwood due to their small body size. Even small ingestions could cause serious neurological and cardiovascular effects. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Small body size significantly increases the risk from boxwood's steroidal alkaloids. Rabbits and guinea pigs that graze near boxwood hedges are at particular risk. The alkaloids can cause seizures and cardiovascular collapse in small animals. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Very limited data on boxwood toxicity in reptiles. The presence of steroidal alkaloids warrants caution. Keep reptiles away from boxwood plants and clippings. |

### Burning Bush (Euonymus)

**UUID:** `9576b9d8-18ca-4a1c-8a33-969ae21b9ceb`

**Entry Severity:** MODERATE

**Alternate Names:** Euonymus, Euonymus alatus, Euonymus atropurpurea, Euonymus europaeus, burning bush, winged burning bush, winged euonymus, wahoo, spindle tree, spindle bush, European spindle, strawberry bush, wintercreeper, Euonymus fortunei, hearts-a-bustin, eastern wahoo, winged spindle

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Most cases cause GI upset only (vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain). The bitter taste usually limits consumption. However, the plant contains cardiac glycosides, so large ingestions â especially by small dogs or puppies â could affect the heart. Any ingestion beyond a taste should be reported to a veterinarian. |
| Cats | MODERATE | Similar concerns as dogs. GI upset is the most common presentation. Cats are less likely to eat significant amounts, but the cardiac glycoside content means even moderate ingestions warrant veterinary evaluation. |
| Birds | HIGH | Birds are highly sensitive to cardiac glycosides. Their small body size means even minor ingestion could cause serious effects. The berries may be attractive to some bird species. Any suspected ingestion warrants immediate veterinary care. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Small body size increases the risk of significant toxicity from smaller amounts of plant material. Rabbits and other herbivorous small mammals may be more susceptible to the cardiac glycoside effects. Keep all small mammals away from Euonymus. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Very limited data on Euonymus toxicity in reptiles. The presence of both alkaloids and cardiac glycosides warrants caution. Keep reptiles away from the plant. |

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Dogs are most commonly affected. Classic presentation: depressed/somnolent, hypothermic, bradycardic, and dribbling urine. External stimulation causes brief hyperesthesia followed by return to somnolence. With legalization, more severe cases (seizures, coma, death) are being reported â whether from more potent products or adulterants is unknown. Deaths have occurred, particularly with concentrated products or cannabutter. |
| Cats | MODERATE | Cats may show different signs than dogs, including increased locomotor activity (wandering aimlessly, spontaneous jumping), head bobbing/weaving, swaying, anxiety, aggression, polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and difficulty swallowing. Sedation and depression also occur. Seizures and coma are possible with large exposures. |
| Birds | MODERATE | Limited data available; birds are susceptible to respiratory irritants from smoke. Seek veterinary care for any suspected exposure. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Limited data available; small body size means even small exposures could cause significant effects. Seek veterinary care for any cannabis exposure in small mammals. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Reptiles have cannabinoid receptors and can be affected by THC. While limited research exists specifically for reptiles, cannabis is listed as toxic to reptiles by Reptiles Magazine. Exposure through ingestion or secondhand smoke can cause disorientation, lethargy, and respiratory distress. Tortoises and lizards should be kept away from all cannabis products. |

**UUID:** `dfa90432-20a6-45bb-9e19-f917b50b3765`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** Kalanchoe spp, mother of thousands, mother of millions, chandelier plant, devil's backbone, cathedral bells, flaming Katy, florist kalanchoe, paddle plant, flapjacks, Bryophyllum, air plant, palm beachbells, donkey ears, kalanchoe daigremontiana, kalanchoe blossfeldiana

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Most ingestions cause only vomiting and GI upset; dogs typically do not eat enough to cause cardiac effects |
| Cats | MODERATE | Same as dogs â GI upset is the primary concern; cardiac effects are rare |
| Birds | HIGH | Birds are more susceptible to cardiac glycosides due to small body size; can cause depression, ataxia, tremors, seizures, and cardiac effects |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Bufadienolides (cardiac glycosides) documented to affect rabbit and guinea pig cardiac tissue in research studies; mechanism of Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition is universal to all mammals |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Cardiac glycosides affect all vertebrates through Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition; limited direct reptile data but the mechanism is not species-specific |

### Lantana

**UUID:** `1d9f0989-6d98-4305-ac74-56f6e6e8ca0f`

**Entry Severity:** MODERATE

**Alternate Names:** Lantana camara, lantana plant, lantana berries, shrub verbena, yellow sage, red sage, wild sage, ham and eggs, big sage, tickberry, white sage, lantadene, pentacyclic triterpenoids

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Most cases involve GI upset; liver damage is possible with significant ingestions, particularly of unripe berries; less commonly reported than in livestock but mechanism of toxicity is the same |
| Cats | MODERATE | Same concerns as dogs; cats are less likely to consume large amounts but smaller body size means less plant material needed for effects |
| Birds | HIGH | Birds may be attracted to the berries; small body size increases risk of serious toxicity |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Guinea pigs are particularly susceptible to lantana toxicity and are used as animal models in toxicity studies. All parts of the plant are toxic, with unripe berries being most dangerous. Small mammals cannot vomit, so ingested toxins remain in their system. Can cause serious illness including liver damage and potentially death. |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Highly toxic to tortoises and other herbivorous reptiles. The Tortoise Table lists all parts as highly toxic. Green berries and foliage can cause fatal damage to the kidneys, lungs, heart, and nervous system in tortoises. Multiple tortoise care resources note lantana ingestion can be fatal. |

### Morning Glory

**UUID:** `a0716b51-b922-4b95-b557-a08c5ce9ed86`

**Entry Severity:** MODERATE

**Alternate Names:** Ipomoea, Ipomoea tricolor, Ipomoea purpurea, Ipomoea violacea, heavenly blue, flying saucers, pearly gates, Convolvulus, bindweed, morning glory seeds, LSA, lysergic acid amide, ergine

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | LOW | Foliage causes only mild GI upset; seed ingestion in large quantities can cause hallucinogenic effects, incoordination, and rarely liver damage â severity depends on amount and species of morning glory |
| Cats | LOW | Same as dogs; cats are less likely to consume large quantities of seeds |
| Birds | MODERATE | Morning glory seeds contain lysergic acid amide (LSA), a hallucinogenic alkaloid similar to LSD. Birds can develop digestive upset, mouth pain, and in rare cases difficulty breathing when seeds are ingested. The seeds are the most toxic part of the plant. Foliage ingestion typically causes milder symptoms. |
| Small Mammals | LOW | Rabbits and other small mammals: foliage may cause GI upset; monitor for lethargy, anorexia, abdominal pain, or diarrhea |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | The Tortoise Table advises against feeding morning glory to tortoises. The seeds contain small amounts of hallucinogenic alkaloids and are also a diuretic. While the leaves may cause less severe effects than seeds, the plant should be avoided. Can cause vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, and loss of appetite if ingested. |

### Nicotine & Tobacco Products

**UUID:** `fd98d3c0-368c-4b20-9192-c98dd3c17f14`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

*(Also in: Recreational Substances)*

**Alternate Names:** nicotine, tobacco, cigarette, cigarettes, cigarette butt, cigarette butts, cigar, cigars, e-cigarette, e-cigarettes, electronic cigarette, electronic cigarettes, vape, vaping, vape juice, vape liquid, e-juice, e-liquid, e juice, e liquid, nicotine liquid, nicotine solution, nicotine patch, nicotine patches, nicotine gum, nicotine lozenge, nicotine lozenges, nicotine inhaler, nicotine nasal spray, nicotine replacement, nicotine replacement therapy, NRT, chewing tobacco, smokeless tobacco, snuff, snus, dip, dipping tobacco, pipe tobacco, Nicotiana, tobacco plant, nicotine poisoning, nicotine toxicosis, nicotine intoxication, tobacco poisoning, tobacco toxicosis, e-juice poisoning, e-liquid poisoning, ashtray, ash tray, cigarette pack, Juul, vape pen, vape pod, Nicorette, Nicoderm, Habitrol, Commit lozenge, nicotine pouch, nicotine pouches, Zyn, Zyn pouch, Zyn pouches, On!, On! pouch, Rogue, Rogue nicotine, Lucy, Lucy nicotine, oral nicotine, tobacco-free nicotine

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | Dogs are most commonly affected due to their scavenging behavior. Cigarette butts in ashtrays, discarded chewing tobacco, and e-liquids are frequent exposure sources. Nicotine gum and lozenges containing xylitol pose a double toxicity risk. Even small exposures to concentrated nicotine liquids can be rapidly fatal. |
| Cats | SEVERE | Cats are highly susceptible to nicotine toxicity. Exposure is less common than in dogs but equally dangerous. Dermal exposure can occur if cats walk through spilled e-liquids and groom themselves. |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds are highly sensitive to nicotine and respiratory irritants. Their small size and rapid metabolism make even minor exposures potentially fatal. Secondhand smoke exposure is also harmful to birds. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Rabbits, guinea pigs, ferrets, and other small mammals are extremely susceptible to nicotine toxicity due to their small body size. Even minimal exposure can be life-threatening. |
| Reptiles | SEVERE | Limited data available, but nicotine is expected to be highly toxic to reptiles. Avoid any exposure and seek veterinary care immediately if exposure occurs. |

### Periwinkle (Vinca)

**UUID:** `114b7d96-5dfe-4fe0-8fbf-fbbc19397409`

**Entry Severity:** MODERATE

**Alternate Names:** Vinca, Vinca rosea, Vinca major, Vinca minor, Catharanthus roseus, Catharanthus, periwinkle, Madagascar periwinkle, greater periwinkle, lesser periwinkle, running myrtle, myrtle, creeping myrtle, flower of death, Vinca vine, periwinkle ground cover, rosy periwinkle, old maid, Apocynaceae

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Most dogs take only a small taste due to the extremely bitter flavor and experience mild GI upset at most. However, Catharanthus roseus contains potent vinca alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine) that can cause serious neurological and cardiovascular effects with larger ingestions. Puppies are at highest risk. A fatal poisoning has been documented in a young puppy. |
| Cats | MODERATE | Similar concerns as dogs. Cats are less likely to consume significant amounts due to the bitter taste. The vinca alkaloids can cause hypotension, tremors, and seizures if enough is ingested. |
| Birds | HIGH | Small body size makes birds highly susceptible to the effects of vinca alkaloids. Even small ingestions could cause serious effects including neurological symptoms. Keep birds away from all periwinkle species. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Small body size significantly increases the risk of serious toxicity. Rabbits and other small mammals that graze on periwinkle ground cover could be at particular risk. The vinca alkaloids are potent at relatively small amounts. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Very limited data. The presence of potent vinca alkaloids warrants caution. Keep reptiles away from periwinkle plants. |

### Poison Ivy, Poison Oak & Poison Sumac

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef17`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Outdoor Hazards, Informational)*

**Alternate Names:** poison ivy, Toxicodendron radicans, eastern poison ivy, western poison ivy, poison oak, Toxicodendron diversilobum, Pacific poison oak, Atlantic poison oak, poison sumac, Toxicodendron vernix, thunderwood, poison elder, urushiol, Toxicodendron, leaves of three

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | LOW | Dogs rarely develop reactions to urushiol oil. Their fur protects skin from direct contact. The main concern is transferring oil to owners when petted. |
| Cats | LOW | Cats rarely develop reactions to urushiol oil. Their fur protects skin from direct contact. The main concern is transferring oil to owners when petted. |
| Birds | LOW | Birds are largely protected from urushiol by their feathers. Unfeathered areas could potentially be irritated by direct contact. The main concern is birds transferring oil to owners when handled. |
| Small Mammals | LOW | Small mammals are protected by their fur similar to dogs and cats. Allergic contact dermatitis is uncommon. The primary concern is that they can carry urushiol oil on their coat and transfer it to humans. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Reptile scales provide protection from urushiol contact. Herbivorous reptiles in outdoor enclosures may contact these plants. The main concern is oil transfer to handlers rather than harm to the reptile. |

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Dogs are generally not attracted to privet and clinical cases are uncommon; most ingestions cause only GI upset (vomiting, diarrhea); however, large ingestions â especially of berries â can cause incoordination, cardiac effects, and rarely death; puppies and small dogs are at greater risk |
| Cats | MODERATE | Same GI effects as dogs; cats are less likely to consume significant quantities of hedge plants but any ingestion should be taken seriously |
| Birds | MODERATE | Wild birds consume privet berries and disperse the seeds without apparent ill effects, but pet birds â particularly smaller species like budgies and finches â may be more sensitive; keep pet birds away from privet clippings or berries brought indoors |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Rabbits, guinea pigs, and other small mammals are susceptible; rabbits cannot vomit, so ingested toxins remain in the system longer; as hindgut fermenters, rabbits may be especially susceptible to compounds like syringin that have documented renal effects in horses (also hindgut fermenters); even small amounts of leaves or berries can cause significant effects due to small body size |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Tortoises and herbivorous reptiles are specifically documented as susceptible to privet toxicity; do not use privet leaves or branches as enclosure decorations or food; listed on reptile toxic plant databases |

| Dogs | LOW | Most cases involve localized skin irritation that resolves within hours; hunting and working dogs with heavy exposure may develop more serious symptoms; hair coat provides some protection |
| Cats | LOW | Similar to dogs; cats are less likely to have heavy exposure due to lifestyle; localized skin reaction is most common |
| Birds | LOW | The danger from stinging nettle is primarily contact irritation from the stinging hairs, not systemic toxicity from ingestion; dried or cooked nettle is safe and used in animal feeds; pet birds may experience oral irritation if they contact fresh plant material |
| Small Mammals | LOW | Stinging hairs cause contact irritation to exposed skin; dried nettle is commonly used as a safe supplement for rabbits and other small mammals; the main concern is immediate discomfort from contact with fresh plants |
| Reptiles | LOW | Contact with stinging hairs may cause localized irritation; reptile scales provide some protection but mouth and eye areas are vulnerable; dried nettle does not retain stinging properties and is safe |

### Tomato & Potato Plants

**UUID:** `d8d69209-6177-411e-bd92-c541af9fe79d`

**Entry Severity:** MODERATE

*(Also in: Foods)*

**Alternate Names:** tomato plant, tomato leaves, tomato stems, green tomatoes, unripe tomatoes, cherry tomato plant, Solanum, Solanum lycopersicum, potato plant, potato leaves, potato stems, green potatoes, raw potatoes, potato skins, Solanum tuberosum, nightshade family, Solanaceae, solanine, tomatine, glycoalkaloids

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Most cases cause only GI upset; severe toxicity requires ingestion of large amounts of green plant material; puppies and small dogs are at higher risk; documented cases of seizures exist with significant green tomato ingestion |
| Cats | MODERATE | Cats are susceptible but rarely consume enough plant material to cause severe toxicity; same clinical signs as dogs expected |
| Birds | MODERATE | Birds may be affected; small body size increases risk from smaller exposures |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | The leaves, stems, and green parts of tomato and potato plants contain glycoalkaloids (solanine and tomatine) that are toxic to rabbits, guinea pigs, and other small mammals. Green potatoes and sprouts are especially dangerous. Can cause digestive upset, decreased appetite, lethargy, abdominal pain, and in severe cases neurological symptoms. |
| Reptiles | HIGH | All parts of the potato plant are highly toxic to tortoises, whether raw or cooked. The glycoalkaloids solanine and chaconine can cause neurological and digestive issues. In large amounts, these compounds can be fatal to tortoises. Tomato plant leaves and stems are also toxic. Contact a veterinarian immediately if ingestion is suspected. |

### Tradescantia (Wandering Jew)

**UUID:** `be55d11f-23dc-4c16-a5a5-545740026b2b`

**Entry Severity:** LOW

**Alternate Names:** Tradescantia, Tradescantia zebrina, Tradescantia fluminensis, Tradescantia pallida, Tradescantia nanouk, wandering jew, wandering jew plant, wandering dude, inch plant, spiderwort, dayflower, purple heart, purple queen, silver inch plant, small-leaf spiderwort, Commelinaceae, tradescantia nanouk, Nanouk, Moses in the cradle

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | LOW | Primary concern is allergic contact dermatitis, especially in dogs that walk through or lie on the plant. Skin irritation affects areas with less fur (underbelly, groin, armpits). Repeated exposure worsens symptoms. Secondary skin infections can develop from scratching. |
| Cats | LOW | Can cause dermatitis if sap contacts skin and mild GI upset if ingested. Cats that chew trailing vines may develop oral irritation. Less commonly affected than dogs because cats have more fur coverage. |
| Birds | LOW | Limited data available. Birds should be kept away from Tradescantia as a precaution, as the irritant compounds could affect their sensitive skin and respiratory systems. |
| Small Mammals | LOW | Limited data available. The irritant sap could cause skin irritation or mild GI upset if ingested. Keep small mammals away from the plant as a precaution. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Very limited data. Reptiles are unlikely to ingest this plant, but the irritant sap could potentially cause skin or mucous membrane irritation. |

### Tulips & Hyacinths

**UUID:** `81d94db6-b452-4997-818a-fb89fde196fa`

**Entry Severity:** MODERATE

*(Also in: Holiday Hazards)*

**Alternate Names:** tulip, tulip bulb, Tulipa, Tulipa spp, hyacinth, hyacinth bulb, Hyacinthus, Hyacinthus orientalis, Dutch hyacinth, garden hyacinth, spring bulbs, flower bulbs, tulipalin, tuliposide

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Dogs are most commonly affected because they dig up and chew on bulbs; ingestion of flowers or leaves typically causes only mild, transient GI upset |
| Cats | MODERATE | Cats may chew on leaves or flowers; bulb ingestion is less common but equally dangerous; note that cats with nausea may seek out plants to help them vomit, so plant material in vomitus is not always the primary cause of illness |
| Birds | MODERATE | Birds may be affected if they chew on plant material; limited data available |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Tulips and hyacinths are toxic to rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, and chinchillas; all bulb plants are considered dangerous to small mammals; can cause severe GI upset, weakness, and potentially fatal outcomes in small pets |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Both tulips and hyacinths are listed as toxic to tortoises and reptiles; the alkaloid compounds (tulipalin A and B) and glycosides affect reptiles similarly to mammals; should not be planted in or near reptile enclosures |

### Wild Mushrooms

**UUID:** `1ce957ec-633a-4946-9b76-933a16dfdb5c`

**Entry Severity:** HIGH

**Alternate Names:** mushroom, mushrooms, toadstool, toadstools, Amanita, death cap, death angel, destroying angel, Amanita phalloides, Amanita ocreata, Amanita muscaria, fly agaric, Galerina, Lepiota, Inocybe, Clitocybe, Gyromitra, false morel, magic mushrooms, psilocybin, Psilocybe, shrooms, yard mushrooms, backyard mushrooms, lawn mushrooms

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs are most commonly affected due to scavenging behavior; dogs may be attracted to certain mushrooms (Amanita, Inocybe) due to their fishy odor; severity ranges from mild GI upset to life-threatening liver failure depending on species â all wild mushroom ingestions should be treated as potential emergencies |
| Cats | HIGH | Cats rarely eat mushrooms but can be seriously affected when they do; cats are particularly attracted to DRIED Amanita muscaria and A. pantherina, sometimes with fatal results |
| Birds | HIGH | Limited data but birds are assumed to be susceptible; small body size increases risk from even small exposures |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Rabbits, guinea pigs, and other small mammals are susceptible to mushroom toxins; small body size increases risk; rabbits cannot vomit so toxin elimination is impaired â treat any wild mushroom ingestion as an emergency |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Limited data on reptile susceptibility to mushroom toxins; herbivorous reptiles housed outdoors may encounter wild mushrooms; assume toxicity similar to other species and seek veterinary care if ingestion suspected |

### Wisteria

**UUID:** `b2e1e5d4-0d12-410b-83dc-da106bbc2199`

**Entry Severity:** HIGH

**Alternate Names:** Wisteria spp, Wisteria sinensis, Wisteria floribunda, Chinese wisteria, Japanese wisteria, American wisteria, wisteria vine, wisteria pods, wisteria seeds

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Seeds and pods are most dangerous â as few as two seeds can cause severe illness in small dogs; entire plant is toxic |
| Cats | HIGH | Same toxicity concerns as dogs; smaller body size increases risk from even minimal seed ingestion |
| Birds | HIGH | Birds are susceptible; small body size makes even small exposures potentially serious |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | All parts of wisteria are toxic to rabbits, guinea pigs, and other small mammals; the seeds and pods are most dangerous and can cause severe GI upset; small body size increases risk from even minimal seed ingestion |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Wisteria is listed as toxic to tortoises and reptiles; the lectin and wisterin glycoside cause GI distress; should not be planted near tortoise enclosures |

### Yellow Jessamine

**UUID:** `f96f5ad9-369a-413e-a899-971f6423a683`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** Carolina jessamine, Carolina jasmine, Gelsemium sempervirens, Gelsemium, yellow jasmine, false jasmine, evening trumpet, evening trumpet flower, woodbine, poor man's rope, wild jessamine, gelsemium vine

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | EXTREMELY TOXIC â documented fatalities from eating flowers or minimal plant material; bright flowers may attract curious dogs; treat ANY exposure as a life-threatening emergency |
| Cats | SEVERE | Same extreme toxicity as dogs; all exposures should be treated as emergencies |
| Birds | SEVERE | Highly toxic to birds; nectar is toxic to honey bees as well |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Research confirms rabbits and guinea pigs are highly susceptible to Gelsemium alkaloids, showing marked organ congestion, respiratory depression, and severe liver, kidney, and cardiac effects. The minimal lethal dose in small mammals is extremely low. All small mammal exposure should be treated as a life-threatening emergency. |
| Reptiles | SEVERE | The neurotoxic alkaloids (gelsemine) cause progressive paralysis and respiratory failure through effects on nerve transmission. This mechanism would affect any vertebrate with a nervous system. Treat any exposure as an emergency. |

### Yew

**UUID:** `35d425ef-8319-4820-9614-a9b1a0c4cfac`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** Taxus, Taxus baccata, Taxus cuspidata, Taxus canadensis, Taxus brevifolia, Taxus chinensis, Taxus x media, English yew, Japanese yew, Chinese yew, American yew, Canadian yew, Pacific yew, Western yew, ground hemlock, yew tree, yew bush, yew shrub, yew berries, taxine

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | Dogs may chew on yew branches or eat fallen berries; a lethal dose can be consumed simply by playing with branches; death can occur rapidly with no warning signs; no antidote exists |
| Cats | SEVERE | Cats are equally susceptible to taxine cardiotoxicity; smaller body size means even minimal ingestion can be fatal |
| Birds | SEVERE | Budgerigars and canaries are susceptible; interestingly, macaws appear to be resistant, but other pet bird species should be considered at risk |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Chinchillas are potentially susceptible to yew toxicity |
| Reptiles | SEVERE | Taxine alkaloids block sodium and calcium channels in cardiac tissue, a mechanism that would affect any vertebrate with a heart. Limited reptile-specific data, but the universal cardiotoxic mechanism warrants severe classification. Avoid all exposure. |

### Acetaminophen (Tylenol / Paracetamol)

**UUID:** `bb223344-5566-7788-99aa-bbccddeeff11`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** acetaminophen, paracetamol, APAP, N-acetyl-p-aminophenol, Tylenol, Tylenol Extra Strength, Tylenol PM, Tylenol Cold, Tylenol Sinus, Tylenol Arthritis, Percocet, Vicodin, Norco, Lortab, Hydrocodone with acetaminophen, Oxycodone with acetaminophen, Codeine with acetaminophen, Tylenol with Codeine, Tylenol #3, Tylenol #4, Excedrin, Excedrin Migraine, Excedrin Tension Headache, Midol, Midol Complete, NyQuil, DayQuil, Theraflu, Mucinex Fast-Max, Sudafed PE, Robitussin, Alka-Seltzer Plus, Goody's Powder, BC Powder, Anacin, Vanquish, Pamprin, Benadryl Allergy Plus, Coricidin, Contac, Dristan, Sinutab, Actifed, Comtrex, Feverall, Mapap, Ofirmev, Panadol, Calpol, Tempra, Datril, Lemsip, cat ate Tylenol, dog ate Tylenol, cat ate pain pill, gave cat Tylenol, gave cat acetaminophen, Tylenol poisoning cat, brown gums cat, chocolate colored blood, cat face swelling

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs are more resistant than cats but can still develop serious hepatotoxicity from overdose. Methemoglobinemia and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye) can also occur at higher doses. While acetaminophen is sometimes used therapeutically in dogs under veterinary supervision, owner-administered doses frequently cause toxicity. Contact poison control for any exposure. |
| Cats | SEVERE | EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Cats cannot properly metabolize acetaminophen due to deficient glucuronidation. Even a single regular-strength Tylenol tablet (325 mg) can be fatal to a cat. One kitten developed toxicosis after playing with an empty pill container. NEVER give acetaminophen to cats under any circumstances. |
| Birds | HIGH | Limited data on avian acetaminophen toxicity. Birds have unique metabolic pathways and should be considered at high risk. Contact an avian veterinarian immediately. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Ferrets, rabbits, and other small mammals are likely highly sensitive to acetaminophen given their small body size and potentially limited metabolic capacity. Assume extreme danger. Contact poison control immediately. |
| Reptiles | SEVERE | EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Snakes and many other reptiles lack the liver enzyme (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase) needed to safely metabolize acetaminophen â the same deficiency that makes cats so sensitive. Acetaminophen causes methemoglobinemia in snakes and is so reliably lethal that it is used as a reptile control agent for invasive brown tree snakes in wildlife management programs. Assume any reptile exposure is life-threatening and seek emergency veterinary care immediately. |

### ADHD Medications (Amphetamines & Stimulants)

**UUID:** `11889900-aabb-ccdd-eeff-112233445566`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** ADHD medication, ADHD medicine, ADD medication, attention deficit medication, stimulant medication, amphetamine, amphetamines, Adderall, Adderall XR, mixed amphetamine salts, amphetamine salts, lisdexamfetamine, lisdexamphetamine, Vyvanse, dextroamphetamine, Dexedrine, Dexedrine Spansule, Zenzedi, ProCentra, methamphetamine, Desoxyn, methylphenidate, Ritalin, Ritalin LA, Ritalin SR, Concerta, Methylin, Methylin ER, Daytrana, Quillivant, Quillichew, QuilliChew ER, Jornay PM, Aptensio XR, Metadate, Metadate CD, dexmethylphenidate, Focalin, Focalin XR, Evekeo, Dyanavel XR, crystal meth, ecstasy, MDMA, speed, dog ate Adderall, cat ate Adderall, dog ate Ritalin, dog ate Vyvanse, cat ate Vyvanse, dog ate Concerta, pet ate ADHD pill, dog got into Adderall, cat ate stimulant

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | Dogs typically show obvious hyperactivity â pacing, circling, inability to sit still, tremors, and dilated pupils. Hyperthermia from muscle activity can become life-threatening. Methylphenidate appears to be more toxic than amphetamines at equivalent doses. Extended-release formulations cause delayed but prolonged toxicity. With prompt aggressive treatment, most dogs recover, but fatalities have been reported. |
| Cats | SEVERE | CATS ARE ESPECIALLY AT RISK: Unlike most medications, cats find Adderall XR and Vyvanse highly palatable and will eat entire pills. Cats may show hyperactivity OR sit unusually still and stare â but internal cardiovascular effects (elevated heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature) occur regardless of outward behavior. A single Adderall capsule can be life-threatening to an average-sized cat. Vyvanse is also highly palatable to cats with delayed onset up to 72 hours. |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds are highly sensitive to stimulant effects. Cardiovascular effects and hyperthermia are particularly dangerous in avian species. Contact an avian veterinarian or poison control immediately. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Small body size makes even small amounts potentially lethal. CNS stimulation, cardiovascular effects, and hyperthermia expected. Contact poison control immediately for any exposure. |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Limited data available. Stimulant effects expected. Temperature regulation is already challenging in reptiles, so drug-induced changes could be especially problematic. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian. |

### Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA)

**UUID:** `88ff6677-99aa-bbcc-ddee-ff0011223344`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** alpha lipoic acid, lipoic acid, ALA, thioctic acid, alpha-lipoic acid, R-lipoic acid, R-ALA, Thioctaid, Thioctan, Lipoicin, Biletan, acetate replacing factor, antioxidant supplement, diabetes supplement, weight loss supplement, nerve support supplement, pet antioxidant supplement, diabetic pet supplement, pet diabetes supplement, cat ate supplement, dog ate ALA, cat ate alpha lipoic acid, pet ate vitamin, dog ate antioxidant

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs can develop hypoglycemia, neurologic signs (ataxia, tremors, seizures), and potentially liver or kidney injury. Case reports include fatalities. Signs may appear within 30 minutes to several hours. Contact poison control or your veterinarian immediately for any ingestion of ALA supplements. |
| Cats | SEVERE | CATS ARE 10 TIMES MORE SENSITIVE than dogs, humans, or rats. In published case series, 2 of 4 cats with known ALA ingestions died. Signs include vomiting, neurologic dysfunction, hepatotoxicity, and potentially acute kidney failure. ANY ingestion of ALA by a cat should be treated as a medical emergency. Do not wait for symptoms â seek veterinary care immediately. |
| Birds | HIGH | No published data on avian ALA toxicity. Birds have high metabolic rates and are very sensitive to blood sugar changes. Assume significant risk and contact an avian veterinarian immediately. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Limited data available. Given the small body size of rabbits, guinea pigs, and ferrets, assume significant sensitivity. Hypoglycemia can be rapidly fatal in small mammals. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian or poison control immediately. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Very limited data available. Reptiles have different glucose metabolism but effects are unpredictable. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian for guidance. |

### Antidepressants (SSRIs & SNRIs)

**UUID:** `dd445566-7788-99aa-bbcc-ddeeff334455`

**Entry Severity:** HIGH

**Alternate Names:** antidepressant, SSRI, SNRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, serotonin reuptake inhibitor, serotonin syndrome, fluoxetine, Prozac, Reconcile, Sarafem, Selfemra, sertraline, Zoloft, paroxetine, Paxil, Pexeva, Brisdelle, citalopram, Celexa, escitalopram, Lexapro, fluvoxamine, Luvox, venlafaxine, Effexor, Effexor XR, duloxetine, Cymbalta, desvenlafaxine, Pristiq, nefazodone, Serzone, trazodone, Desyrel, Oleptro, mirtazapine, Remeron, Mirataz, bupropion, Wellbutrin, Zyban, tricyclic antidepressant, TCA, amitriptyline, Elavil, clomipramine, Clomicalm, Anafranil, doxepin, Sinequan, imipramine, Tofranil, nortriptyline, Pamelor, 5-HTP, 5-hydroxytryptophan, hydroxytryptophan, L-tryptophan, tryptophan, Griffonia seed extract, Griffonia, buspirone, BuSpar, dog ate Prozac, dog ate antidepressant, cat ate Zoloft, dog ate Effexor, pet ate depression medication, dog ate 5-HTP, dog ate trazodone, cat ate mirtazapine

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs commonly develop serotonin syndrome from antidepressant ingestion. Signs typically begin within 1-2 hours. Fluoxetine (Reconcile) and clomipramine (Clomicalm) are prescribed for behavioral issues â be aware if your dog is already on these medications, as additional serotonergic exposure increases risk. |
| Cats | HIGH | Cats can develop serotonin syndrome, often from prescribed medications like mirtazapine (appetite stimulant) or trazodone (anxiety). Dosing errors and accidental overdoses are common causes. Cats appear to preferentially ingest venlafaxine (Effexor) capsules. If your cat is already on a serotonergic medication, any additional exposure requires immediate veterinary evaluation. |
| Birds | HIGH | Limited data on avian antidepressant toxicity. Some SSRIs have been used experimentally in birds, but overdose risk is significant. Contact an avian veterinarian immediately. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Limited data on serotonin syndrome in small mammals. Given their small body size and the potency of these medications, assume significant risk. Contact poison control immediately. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Very limited data on reptile serotonin syndrome. Given the neurological nature of the toxicity, assume potential risk. Contact a reptile veterinarian for guidance. |

### Aspirin & Salicylates

**UUID:** `cc334455-6677-8899-aabb-ccddeeff2233`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** aspirin, acetylsalicylic acid, ASA, salicylic acid, salicylate, salicylates, methyl salicylate, methylsalicylate, Bayer, Bayer Aspirin, Bufferin, Excedrin, Anacin, Ecotrin, St. Joseph Aspirin, BC Powder, Goody's Powder, Alka-Seltzer, Ascriptin, Aspro, Disprin, Caprin, Nu-Seals, Micropirin, Entrophen, Pepto-Bismol, Pepto Bismol, Peptobismol, pink bismuth, Kaopectate, bismuth subsalicylate, BSS, oil of wintergreen, wintergreen oil, wintergreen, gaultheria oil, sweet birch oil, birch oil, methyl salicylate oil, Bengay, Ben-Gay, BenGay, Icy Hot, IcyHot, Aspercreme, Sportscreme, Flexall, Tiger Balm, Salonpas, Absorbine Jr, Thera-Gesic, Ultra Strength Bengay, Muscle Rub, Deep Heat, aspirn, asprin, aspen, acesal, asa baby aspirin, baby aspirin, low dose aspirin, low-dose aspirin, enteric coated aspirin, Excedrin Migraine, Vanquish, Empirin, Zorprin, Measurin, Bayer Back & Body, Excedrin Extra Strength, aspirin for dogs, canine aspirin, pet aspirin

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | GI ulceration is the primary concern; can occur even at 'therapeutic' doses without food. Dogs lack the ability to safely metabolize aspirin over extended periods. Never give without veterinary guidance. |
| Cats | SEVERE | EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Cats cannot effectively glucuronidate salicylatesâhalf-life is 38+ hours vs 7.5 hours in dogs. A single 325 mg aspirin can cause severe toxicity. ONE Pepto-Bismol dose can be toxic. Oil of wintergreen is rapidly fatal. |
| Birds | SEVERE | Highly toxic; causes severe GI bleeding, kidney failure, and death at very low doses. No safe dose exists for birds. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Ferrets, rabbits, guinea pigsâextremely sensitive. Even small doses can cause fatal GI ulceration and metabolic acidosis. Never administer. |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Limited data but presumed highly sensitive due to slow metabolism. Avoid all salicylate exposure. |

### Asthma Inhalers

**UUID:** `88990011-2233-4455-6677-889900aabb01`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** asthma inhaler, inhaler, asthma medication, rescue inhaler, bronchodilator, bronchodilator inhaler, metered dose inhaler, MDI, puffer, albuterol, albuterol inhaler, salbutamol, Ventolin, Ventolin HFA, ProAir, ProAir HFA, Proventil, Proventil HFA, Accuneb, VoSpire, VoSpire ER, beta agonist, beta-agonist, beta-2 agonist, terbutaline, metaproterenol, Alupent, pirbuterol, levalbuterol, Xopenex, Combivent, ipratropium albuterol, DuoNeb, fluticasone, Flovent, Flovent HFA, steroid inhaler, inhaled steroid, inhaled corticosteroid, beclomethasone, QVAR, budesonide, Pulmicort, dog chewed inhaler, dog bit inhaler, dog punctured inhaler, cat chewed inhaler, pet ate inhaler, dog ate Ventolin, dog ate albuterol, dog chewed Flovent

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs are most commonly affected because they chew on and puncture inhaler canisters. ASPCA tracked over 400 cases of beta-agonist inhaler toxicosis in dogs. A 60-pound dog puncturing a full Ventolin canister can receive approximately 10 times the therapeutic dose. Greyhounds may be more susceptible to rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown). With prompt veterinary treatment, most dogs recover, but the cardiovascular effects require aggressive management. |
| Cats | HIGH | Cats are less likely to chew into inhalers, so exposures are less common. Albuterol is actually used therapeutically in cats with feline asthma (via specialized delivery devices like AeroKatÂ®). However, overdose from a punctured canister would cause the same cardiovascular toxicity seen in dogs.\n\nAn interesting note: the S-enantiomer in racemic albuterol can actually cause airway inflammation in cats with repeated therapeutic use. |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds are extremely sensitive to cardiovascular effects due to their high metabolic rate and unique cardiac physiology. Even small exposures could be rapidly fatal. No specific treatment data exists for avian beta-agonist toxicosis. Contact an avian veterinarian immediately. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Small body size makes even small exposures potentially life-threatening. Rabbits, ferrets, guinea pigs, and other small mammals would experience severe cardiovascular effects and electrolyte disturbances. No specific antidote data exists for these species. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian or poison control immediately for any exposure. |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Limited data on beta-agonist toxicity in reptiles. Cardiovascular effects would be expected, though reptilian metabolism differs significantly from mammals. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian for guidance on any exposure. |

### Benzocaine (Orajel, Anbesol)

**UUID:** `ddee1122-ff33-4455-6677-889900aabbcc`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** benzocaine, aminobenzoate, ethyl aminobenzoate, topical anesthetic, local anesthetic, Orajel, Baby Orajel, Orajel gel, Anbesol, Anbesol gel, Cepacol, Cepacol lozenges, Chloraseptic, sore throat spray, throat spray, Americaine, Lanacane, Dermoplast, Solarcaine, Bactine, Sting-Kill, Cetacaine, Topex, Hurricane spray, methemoglobinemia, methemoglobin, brown blood, chocolate blood, benzocaine toxicity, benzocaine poisoning, dog ate Orajel, cat licked Orajel, dog ate teething gel, dog ate throat lozenges, dog ate sore throat spray, cat ate Anbesol, pet brown gums, muddy gums dog, muddy gums cat

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs are more resistant to benzocaine-induced methemoglobinemia than cats, but toxicity still occurs. Most cases result from ingestion of lozenges, topical application to irritated or inflamed skin (which enhances absorption), or use of benzocaine throat sprays. Dogs with cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency are at increased riskâbreeds with reported deficiencies include Chihuahua, Borzoi, English Setter, Cardigan Welsh Corgi, Pomeranian, Poodles, American Cocker Spaniel, Coonhound, and certain mixes. Signs can develop within hours. Chocolate-brown blood and 'muddy' gums are characteristic. Never use human benzocaine products on dogs. |
| Cats | SEVERE | CATS ARE EXTREMELY SUSCEPTIBLE to benzocaine-induced methemoglobinemia. Signs can develop within 20-30 minutes of even a single topical application. A study showed significant methemoglobinemia in cats after just a 2-second spray. Cats that ingest benzocaine (licking products, eating lozenges) or have it applied topically can rapidly develop life-threatening toxicity. Signs include muddy brown gums, rapid breathing, weakness, vomiting, and collapse. This is a MEDICAL EMERGENCY requiring immediate veterinary care. |
| Birds | HIGH | Limited data available. Birds may be susceptible to methemoglobinemia from benzocaine exposure due to their small body size and potentially similar hemoglobin oxidation mechanisms. Any exposure should be treated as potentially serious. Contact an avian veterinarian immediately if exposure occurs. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Rabbits are highly susceptible to benzocaine-induced methemoglobinemia, similar to cats. Ferrets have also shown positive methemoglobin responses. Never use human benzocaine products on small mammals. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian immediately if exposure occurs. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Toxicity not well-established in reptiles. Reptile physiology differs significantly from mammals, and susceptibility to benzocaine-induced methemoglobinemia is unknown. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian if exposure occurs. |

### Benzodiazepines (Anti-Anxiety & Sleep Medications)

**UUID:** `ee556677-8899-aabb-ccdd-eeff00112244`

**Entry Severity:** HIGH

**Alternate Names:** benzodiazepine, benzo, benzos, tranquilizer, anti-anxiety medication, anxiety medication, sleep medication, sleeping pill, sedative, alprazolam, Xanax, Xanax XR, Niravam, diazepam, Valium, Diastat, Valtoco, Diazepam Intensol, lorazepam, Ativan, Loreev, Loreev XR, clonazepam, Klonopin, temazepam, Restoril, triazolam, Halcion, midazolam, Versed, Nayzilam, Seizalam, chlordiazepoxide, Librium, oxazepam, Serax, clorazepate, Tranxene, flurazepam, Dalmane, estazolam, ProSom, clobazam, Onfi, Sympazan, quazepam, Doral, dog ate Xanax, dog ate Valium, cat ate Xanax, dog ate anxiety medication, pet ate sleeping pill, dog got into Klonopin, cat ate benzodiazepine

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Dogs generally tolerate benzodiazepine exposure well, with most cases involving sedation and ataxia that resolve with supportive care. Paradoxical excitation (agitation, aggression) is common in healthy, non-geriatric adults when benzodiazepines are given alone. Clorazepate has been associated with hepatotoxicity in dogs with long-term use. Tolerance and physical dependence can develop with chronic exposure. |
| Cats | HIGH | Cats are more susceptible to benzodiazepine adverse effects due to glucuronidation metabolism. CRITICAL: Oral diazepam (ValiumÂ®) has caused acute, fatal hepatic necrosis in cats â deaths reported as early as 5 days after starting, with rapid deterioration within 24 hours. Lorazepam and oxazepam appear safer alternatives. Paradoxical excitation can also occur. All cat exposures warrant veterinary evaluation. |
| Birds | MODERATE | Benzodiazepines are sometimes used therapeutically in birds. Toxicity data is limited. Sedation, ataxia, and respiratory depression possible. Contact an avian veterinarian or poison control. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Limited toxicity data in small mammals. Small body size increases risk of significant effects. Sedation and ataxia expected. Contact poison control for species-specific guidance. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Benzodiazepines are occasionally used in reptile medicine. Limited overdose data available. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian for guidance. |

### Birth Control Pills

**UUID:** `77ee5566-ff00-1122-3344-556677889900`

**Entry Severity:** MODERATE

**Alternate Names:** birth control, birth control pill, contraceptive, contraceptive pill, oral contraceptive, the pill, hormone pill, Yaz, Yasmin, Ortho Tri-Cyclen, Lo Loestrin, Loestrin, Seasonique, NuvaRing, Xulane, Beyaz, Alesse, Levlen, Nordette, Mirena, Skyla, Nexplanon, Depo-Provera, estrogen pill, progestin, progesterone, ethinyl estradiol, norgestimate, levonorgestrel, hormone replacement therapy, HRT, Premarin, estradiol, DES, diethylstilbestrol, Plan B, Plan B One-Step, ella, emergency contraceptive, morning after pill, levonorgestrel emergency, ulipristal, dog ate birth control, cat ate birth control pill, dog ate my pill pack, pet ate hormone pill

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | LOW | Dogs commonly chew into birth control pill packs, but actual hormone toxicity is rare. The LOW estrogen content means a 25-pound dog would need to eat 140+ active pills to reach toxic levels. The PACKAGING is often more concerning â swallowed plastic can cause intestinal obstruction. Watch for vomiting, decreased appetite, or lethargy that could indicate obstruction. If only a few pills were eaten, observation at home is usually appropriate. |
| Cats | LOW | Cats rarely ingest birth control pills, but if they do, the low hormone content makes serious toxicity unlikely. Monitor for mild GI upset. Contact your veterinarian if the cat ingested a large number of pills or any packaging material. |
| Birds | MODERATE | BIRDS ARE MORE SENSITIVE to estrogen than mammals. Even relatively small amounts of estrogen can cause bone marrow suppression in birds, potentially leading to fatal aplastic anemia with large ingestions. Any birth control or estrogen ingestion in a bird should be evaluated by an avian veterinarian immediately. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Small body size may increase sensitivity to hormones. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian for guidance on any ingestion. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Limited data available. Hormone effects likely minimal. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian if concerned. |

### Decongestants (Pseudoephedrine & Phenylephrine)

**UUID:** `66dd4455-eeff-0011-2233-445566778899`

**Entry Severity:** HIGH

**Alternate Names:** decongestant, nasal decongestant, cold medicine, cold medication, flu medicine, flu medication, sinus medicine, sinus medication, cough and cold, pseudoephedrine, PSE, Sudafed, Sudafed 12 Hour, Sudafed 24 Hour, Claritin-D, Allegra-D, Zyrtec-D, Mucinex-D, Benadryl-D, Advil Cold & Sinus, Aleve-D, Tylenol Sinus, Contac, Dimetapp, phenylephrine, PE, Sudafed PE, Neo-Synephrine, Preparation H, Sinex, Triaminic, Theraflu, NyQuil, DayQuil, oxymetazoline, Afrin, tetrahydrozoline, Visine, naphazoline, Clear Eyes, dog ate Sudafed, cat ate cold medicine, dog ate Claritin-D, pet ate decongestant, dog ate NyQuil, dog ate DayQuil

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs are commonly affected when they chew into cold/flu medication packages. Pseudoephedrine can cause severe stimulant toxicity similar to amphetamines. Extended-release products are especially concerning because signs may be delayed for hours. ALWAYS check if the medication contains other toxic ingredients like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. |
| Cats | HIGH | Cats are sensitive to sympathomimetic drugs. Additionally, many cold/flu medications contain ACETAMINOPHEN, which is highly toxic to cats. Even a single extra-strength acetaminophen tablet can be fatal to a cat. Always check all active ingredients in any medication a cat may have ingested. |
| Birds | HIGH | Birds are highly sensitive to stimulant effects. Cardiovascular effects can be rapidly fatal. Contact an avian veterinarian or poison control immediately. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Small body size makes decongestant toxicity dangerous. Cardiovascular and CNS effects can be life-threatening. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian immediately. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Limited data available. Cardiovascular effects expected. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian for guidance. |

### Diabetes Medications (Insulin & Oral Hypoglycemics)

**UUID:** `33aa1122-bbcc-ddee-ff00-112233445566`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** diabetes medication, diabetes medicine, diabetic medication, blood sugar medication, antidiabetic, hypoglycemic agent, oral hypoglycemic, insulin, insulin injection, insulin pen, insulin syringe, Vetsulin, Caninsulin, porcine insulin, lente insulin, ProZinc, PZI, Lantus, glargine, Levemir, detemir, Humalog, lispro, NovoLog, aspart, Novolin, Humulin, NPH insulin, regular insulin, Tresiba, degludec, Basaglar, Toujeo, Apidra, glulisine, Fiasp, sulfonylurea, glipizide, Glucotrol, Glucotrol XL, glyburide, glibenclamide, DiaBeta, Micronase, Glynase, glimepiride, Amaryl, metformin, Glucophage, Glucophage XR, Fortamet, Glumetza, Riomet, sitagliptin, Januvia, pioglitazone, Actos, gliclazide, acarbose, Precose, SGLT2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, Jardiance, dapagliflozin, Farxiga, canagliflozin, Invokana, ertugliflozin, Steglatro, dog ate insulin, cat ate insulin, dog ate diabetes pill, cat ate glipizide, pet ate metformin, insulin overdose pet

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | Dogs are highly susceptible to hypoglycemia from insulin or sulfonylurea ingestion. Signs include weakness, lethargy, ataxia, falling down, depression, disorientation, collapse, seizures, and death. Even non-diabetic dogs can become dangerously hypoglycemic. Glipizide is ineffective for diabetic dogs but can still cause toxic hypoglycemia if ingested. |
| Cats | SEVERE | Cats show hunger, anxiety, ataxia, muscle twitching, rear end weakness, disorientation, lethargy, and seizures with hypoglycemia. Obese diabetic cats are at HIGHER RISK for insulin overdose than dogs. Glipizide is sometimes prescribed for diabetic cats â accidental double-dosing can cause hypoglycemia. If signs of low blood sugar occur: apply corn syrup (Karo) to gums and seek veterinary care immediately. |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds have high metabolic rates and are very sensitive to blood sugar changes. Hypoglycemia can be rapidly fatal. Contact an avian veterinarian or poison control immediately. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Small body size makes hypoglycemia extremely dangerous. Rabbits, ferrets, guinea pigs, and other small mammals can become critically hypoglycemic from small amounts of insulin or oral hypoglycemics. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian immediately. |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Limited data available. Reptiles have different glucose metabolism but insulin can still cause hypoglycemia. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian for guidance. |

### Estrogen Medications & Hormone Therapies

**UUID:** `ccdd0011-eeff-2233-4455-667788990011`

**Entry Severity:** HIGH

**Alternate Names:** estrogen toxicosis, estrogen toxicity, estrogen poisoning, hyperestrogenism, hyperoestrogenism, estrogen-induced myelotoxicity, estrogen-induced aplastic anemia, diethylstilbestrol, DES, estradiol, estradiol cypionate, ECP, estriol, stilbestrol, Incurin, hormone replacement therapy, HRT, estrogen cream, estrogen gel, estrogen patch, estrogen spray, transdermal estrogen, topical estrogen, menopausal hormone therapy, Vivelle, Vivelle-Dot, Climara, Estraderm, Alora, Minivelle, Menostar, Estrogel, Divigel, Elestrin, Estrasorb, Evamist, Vagifem, Estring, Femring, Premarin cream, Estrace cream, Prempro, Premphase, Combipatch, Activella, FemHRT, aplastic anemia, bone marrow suppression, pancytopenia, myelotoxicity, dog ate estrogen, dog ate hormone cream, dog licked estrogen, dog licked HRT, dog ate estrogen patch, dog chewed estrogen patch, dog vulva swollen, spayed dog vulva swelling, male dog enlarged nipples, dog hair loss estrogen, hormone replacement poisoning dog

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs are susceptible to estrogen-induced bone marrow suppression, which can progress to fatal aplastic anemia. Effects develop over days to weeks (not immediately). Individual sensitivity variesâsome dogs are severely affected while others tolerate the same exposure. Bone marrow suppression is more common with veterinary estrogen medications, large ingestions, or prolonged exposure. Secondary exposure to topical human HRT products more commonly causes feminization signs (vulvar swelling, hair loss, mammary changes) that typically resolve once exposure stops, though bone marrow effects are still possible with prolonged exposure. Smaller dogs are at higher risk from HRT exposure due to their body weight. |
| Cats | MODERATE | Estrogen-induced bone marrow suppression has rarely been reported in cats. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is generally avoided in cats due to concerns about liver, heart, and pancreas problems. Secondary exposure to human HRT can cause signs of heat (yowling, rolling, behavioral changes) in spayed females and mammary changes. If your cat has been exposed to estrogen products, contact a veterinarian. |
| Birds | HIGH | Birds are MORE SENSITIVE to estrogen than mammals. Even relatively low doses of estrogen can cause bone marrow suppression in birds, which may progress to fatal aplastic anemia. Any estrogen exposure in a bird should be evaluated by an avian veterinarian immediately. Do not wait for symptoms to develop. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Limited data available for small mammals. Ferrets have been reported with signs following topical estrogen exposure. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian if exposure occurs. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Very limited data available on estrogen toxicity in reptiles. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian if estrogen exposure occurs. |

### Fipronil (Frontline)

**UUID:** `a7b8c9d0-1e2f-4a3b-c4d5-6e7f8a9b0c1d`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

*(Also in: Garage & Garden)*

**Alternate Names:** fipronil, Frontline, Frontline Plus, Frontline Gold, Frontline Spray, phenylpyrazole, flea treatment toxicity, dog licked Frontline, cat licked Frontline, fipronil poisoning, spot-on flea medicine, pyriprole

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | LOW | Very well tolerated. Dogs given 5 times the topical dose or 0.5 mg/kg/day orally for 13 weeks showed no adverse effects. Main concern is taste reaction from licking. Safe for pregnant and nursing dogs. |
| Cats | LOW | Very well tolerated at label doses. Cats given 5 times the topical dose showed no adverse effects. Do not use on kittens under 8 weeks of age. |
| Birds | HIGH | Birds are significantly more sensitive to fipronil than mammals. Oral LD50 values are 31 mg/kg in pheasants and 11.3 mg/kg in bobwhite quail (compared to 97 mg/kg in rats). Keep pet birds away from treated animals. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | â ï¸ DANGEROUS TO RABBITS. Fipronil has been associated with deaths in rabbits and should NEVER be used on them. Use imidacloprid-based products (Advantage) for rabbits instead. |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Fipronil is documented as highly toxic to reptiles, particularly lizards. Research shows an LD50 of just 30 micrograms per gram body weight in lacertid lizards. A green iguana death has been reported from fipronil exposure. Studies on bearded dragons showed fipronil reduced activity by nearly 50% and the toxin persisted in blood for over 4 weeks. Reptiles have lower cytochrome P450 activity, impairing their ability to clear the toxin. Never use fipronil-containing flea products near reptile enclosures. Seek immediate veterinary care if exposure occurs. |

### Heart & Blood Pressure Medications

**UUID:** `22990011-aabb-ccdd-eeff-223344556677`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** heart medication, heart medicine, cardiac medication, blood pressure medication, blood pressure medicine, blood pressure pill, heart pill, cardiovascular medication, hypertension medication, calcium channel blocker, CCB, diltiazem, Cardizem, Cardizem CD, Cartia XT, Dilacor XR, Tiazac, Dilt-CD, amlodipine, Norvasc, verapamil, Calan, Verelan, Isoptin, Covera-HS, nifedipine, Procardia, Adalat, felodipine, Plendil, nicardipine, Cardene, isradipine, DynaCirc, nisoldipine, Sular, nimodipine, Nimotop, beta blocker, beta-blocker, atenolol, Tenormin, propranolol, Inderal, InnoPran, metoprolol, Lopressor, Toprol XL, carvedilol, Coreg, sotalol, Betapace, nadolol, Corgard, bisoprolol, Zebeta, nebivolol, Bystolic, labetalol, Trandate, timolol, Blocadren, esmolol, Brevibloc, ACE inhibitor, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, Vasotec, Enacard, lisinopril, Prinivil, Zestril, benazepril, Lotensin, captopril, Capoten, ramipril, Altace, fosinopril, Monopril, quinapril, Accupril, perindopril, Aceon, trandolapril, Mavik, moexipril, Univasc, imidapril, ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker, losartan, Cozaar, valsartan, Diovan, irbesartan, Avapro, olmesartan, Benicar, candesartan, Atacand, telmisartan, Micardis, azilsartan, Edarbi, digoxin, Lanoxin, Digitek, cardiac glycoside, digitalis, dog ate heart medication, dog ate blood pressure pill, cat ate Norvasc, dog ate atenolol, dog ate Cardizem, pet ate Lisinopril, dog ate digoxin

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | Calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers have NARROW margins of safety â even small amounts can cause severe, life-threatening toxicity. About 25% of dogs on digoxin therapy experience toxicity. ACE inhibitors are relatively safer but large ingestions or pets with kidney/heart disease are at risk. Common in households with elderly family members taking cardiac medications. |
| Cats | SEVERE | CATS ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO DIGOXIN than dogs. Calcium channel blockers (especially amlodipine, commonly prescribed for hypertensive cats) and beta-blockers also have narrow safety margins. ACE inhibitors are relatively safer. Any suspected cardiac medication ingestion in cats should be evaluated promptly. |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds are highly sensitive to cardiac-active medications. Cardiovascular effects can be rapidly life-threatening. Contact an avian veterinarian or poison control immediately. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Small body size makes even small amounts potentially dangerous. Limited data on cardiac medication toxicity in small mammals. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian or poison control immediately. |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Limited data available. Cardiovascular effects expected. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian for guidance. |

### Ivermectin & Macrocyclic Lactones

**UUID:** `bbcc9900-ddee-ff11-2233-445566778899`

**Entry Severity:** HIGH

**Alternate Names:** ivermectin, selamectin, moxidectin, doramectin, eprinomectin, abamectin, milbemycin, milbemycin oxime, macrocyclic lactone, avermectin, antiparasitic, dewormer, heartworm medication, Heartgard, Heartgard Plus, Iverhart, Iverhart Plus, Iverhart Max, Tri-Heart Plus, Interceptor, Interceptor Plus, Sentinel, Sentinel Spectrum, Revolution, Revolution Plus, Advantage Multi, Advocate, ProHeart, ProHeart 6, ProHeart 12, Simparica Trio, Trifexis, Coraxis, horse dewormer, horse wormer, equine dewormer, horse paste, ivermectin paste, Ivomec, Zimecterin, Equimectrin, Eqvalan, Bimectin, Duramectin, cattle dewormer, livestock dewormer, pour-on, injectable ivermectin, MDR1, ABCB1, MDR1 mutation, ABCB1 mutation, P-glycoprotein, ivermectin sensitivity, ivermectin sensitive, dog ate horse dewormer, dog ate ivermectin, collie ivermectin, herding dog ivermectin, dog ate heartworm pill, dog ate Heartgard, cat ate ivermectin

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Toxicity depends heavily on DOSE and GENETICS. Dogs with the ABCB1/MDR1 mutation (common in Collies, Australian Shepherds, Shetland Sheepdogs, Border Collies, Old English Sheepdogs, and other herding breeds) are extremely sensitive. Heartworm preventatives are safe at labeled doses for ALL dogs. Horse/livestock dewormers and off-label high-dose treatments are dangerous. Genetic testing is available through Washington State University and other laboratories. Recovery can take days to weeks with supportive veterinary care. |
| Cats | HIGH | Cats do NOT have the ABCB1/MDR1 mutation issue, but can still develop ivermectin toxicity from overdose. Kittens are more susceptible (immature blood-brain barrier). Common cause: owners using horse dewormer or applying inappropriate doses. Signs include ataxia, tremors, mydriasis, and blindness. Most cats recover with supportive care, though blindness may take weeks to resolve. Deaths have been reported. |
| Birds | HIGH | Ivermectin is sometimes used in birds for parasites. Overdose can cause neurologic signs. Birds are sensitive to many medications. Contact an avian veterinarian for any suspected exposure. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Ivermectin is used in rabbits, ferrets, and other small mammals for parasites. Overdose can cause neurologic signs similar to dogs and cats. Young animals and those with compromised blood-brain barriers are at higher risk. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian for guidance. |

### Joint Supplements (Glucosamine & Chondroitin)

**UUID:** `91000011-2233-4455-6677-889900aabb01`

**Entry Severity:** HIGH

**Alternate Names:** glucosamine, chondroitin, chondroitin sulfate, MSM, methylsulfonylmethane, glucosamine hydrochloride, glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine chondroitin, sodium chondroitin sulfate, Cosequin, Dasuquin, Dasuquin Advanced, GlycoFlex, Synovi G4, NutriVet, Phycox, Seraquin, Adequan, VetriScience, Move Free, Schiff Glucosamine, Osteo Bi-Flex, Cosamin DS, Nature Made Glucosamine, joint supplement, joint chews, joint health chews, hip and joint chews, hip and joint supplement, joint support supplement, arthritis supplement, joint care chews, soft chews for joints, dog joint chews, cat joint supplement, nutraceutical, dog ate joint supplements, dog ate glucosamine, dog ate Cosequin, dog ate Dasuquin, dog ate whole bottle of joint chews, pet ate joint supplements, dog got into joint chews, glucosamine overdose, chondroitin overdose, dog ate human glucosamine, glucosimine, glucosamine chondroiten, chondroiten, gluosamine, condroitin

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs are overwhelmingly the most commonly affected species â they are attracted to the flavored soft chews and will consume entire containers if given access. The ASPCA documented 21 cases of liver injury from joint supplement overdose in dogs in just two years. Published case reports describe multi-organ dysfunction including liver failure, kidney injury, blood clotting abnormalities, hypernatremia, and seizures. While many ingestions cause only GI upset, massive overdoses have resulted in fatalities. Human glucosamine supplements are significantly more concentrated than veterinary products â a small dog getting into a human bottle faces an amplified risk. Contact a veterinarian or poison control immediately for any significant ingestion. |
| Cats | MODERATE | Cats are much less commonly affected because they are less likely to consume large quantities of flavored chews. Glucosamine and chondroitin are used therapeutically in cats for joint health and feline lower urinary tract disease at recommended doses. However, the safety of massive overdoses in cats has not been studied.\n\nIMPORTANT: Some "advanced" joint supplements contain alpha lipoic acid (thioctic acid), which is extremely toxic to cats â even small amounts can cause life-threatening effects. Always check the ingredient label. Cats who consume a large quantity of any joint supplement should be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. |
| Birds | LOW | Joint supplement ingestion by birds is unlikely due to product formulation (large chews). No published toxicity data exists for avian species. If a bird consumes any supplement product, contact an avian veterinarian for guidance, as the additional ingredients â particularly zinc or manganese â could be concerning for small-bodied birds. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | No published data on joint supplement toxicity in small mammals. Their small body size means even modest amounts could deliver very high per-body-weight doses of sodium, manganese, and other ingredients. Additionally, some joint supplements may contain xylitol or other sweeteners that pose independent risks to certain species. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian or poison control if ingestion is suspected. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Joint supplement ingestion by reptiles is extremely unlikely. No published toxicity data exists. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian if ingestion is suspected. |

### Metronidazole (Flagyl)

**UUID:** `aabb8899-ccdd-eeff-0011-223344556677`

**Entry Severity:** MODERATE

**Alternate Names:** metronidazole, metro, Flagyl, Flagyl ER, Metrogel, MetroCream, Noritate, Vandazole, antibiotic for dogs, giardia medication, IBD medication, dog ate metronidazole, cat ate Flagyl, metronidazole side effects dog, dog wobbling metronidazole, dog head tilt Flagyl, metronidazole neurologic signs, metronidazole toxicity

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Dogs are the most commonly affected species. Neurotoxicity typically occurs with high doses or prolonged treatment. Classic presentation is a dog that suddenly cannot walk properly, has a head tilt, and shows abnormal eye movements. The GOOD NEWS: signs are usually reversible within 1-2 weeks after stopping the medication. Contact your veterinarian if you notice any neurologic changes while your dog is taking metronidazole. |
| Cats | MODERATE | Cats can develop CNS signs from metronidazole toxicosis, including ataxia, weakness, disorientation, diminished postural reactions, seizures, and APPARENT BLINDNESS. Forebrain involvement may be more prominent in cats than dogs. Signs are generally reversible upon discontinuation. |
| Birds | MODERATE | Metronidazole is used in avian medicine. Limited data on neurotoxicity in birds. Contact an avian veterinarian if you notice neurologic changes during treatment. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Metronidazole is used in rabbits, ferrets, and other small mammals. Neurotoxicity risk exists. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian if you notice ataxia, head tilt, or other neurologic signs in a small mammal receiving metronidazole. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Metronidazole is commonly used in reptiles for protozoal infections. Limited reports of toxicity. Follow prescribed dosing and contact your veterinarian with concerns. |

### Muscle Relaxants

**UUID:** `44bb2233-ccdd-eeff-0011-223344556677`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** muscle relaxant, muscle relaxer, skeletal muscle relaxant, antispasmodic, baclofen, Lioresal, Gablofen, Kemstro, Lyvispah, OZOBAX, Fleqsuvy, cyclobenzaprine, Flexeril, Fexmid, Amrix, carisoprodol, Soma, Soma Compound, Vanadom, tizanidine, Zanaflex, methocarbamol, Robaxin, Robaxin-V, Robinax, Robaximol, metaxalone, Skelaxin, orphenadrine, Norflex, chlorzoxazone, Parafon Forte, dog ate muscle relaxer, cat ate muscle relaxant, dog ate Flexeril, dog ate baclofen, pet ate Soma

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | BACLOFEN is especially dangerous â a single dropped tablet can cause serious toxicosis in a small dog, and deaths have occurred. Signs appear within minutes and can persist 72-96+ hours. Development of seizures indicates worse prognosis. Delay in treatment dramatically worsens outcomes. Other muscle relaxants also cause significant CNS depression. ONLY methocarbamol (Robaxin-V) is FDA-approved for dogs and has a reasonable safety margin. |
| Cats | SEVERE | NO DOSE OF BACLOFEN IS CONSIDERED SAFE FOR CATS. Cyclobenzaprine and other muscle relaxants are also poorly tolerated. Methocarbamol is FDA-approved for cats and is used therapeutically to treat permethrin toxicity (when dog flea products are accidentally applied to cats). However, even methocarbamol can cause toxicity in overdose. |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds are highly sensitive to CNS-depressant medications. Respiratory depression can be rapidly fatal. Contact an avian veterinarian or poison control immediately. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Small body size makes even small amounts of muscle relaxants extremely dangerous. CNS depression can be rapidly life-threatening. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian immediately. |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Limited data available. CNS and respiratory depression expected. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian for guidance. |

### Neonicotinoids (Imidacloprid)

**UUID:** `f6a7b8c9-0d1e-4f2a-b3c4-5d6e7f8a9b0c`

**Entry Severity:** LOW-MODERATE

*(Also in: Garage & Garden)*

**Alternate Names:** imidacloprid, neonicotinoid, Advantage, Advantage II, Advantage Multi, Advocate, Seresto, K9 Advantix, flea treatment licked, cat licked flea medicine, dog licked flea treatment, spot-on flea treatment, dinotefuran, nitenpyram, Capstar, clothianidin, acetamiprid, thiamethoxam, thiacloprid

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | LOW | Very well tolerated. Dogs given 5 times the topical dose or 41 mg/kg/day orally for one year showed no adverse effects. Main concern is taste reaction from licking. Safe for pregnant and nursing dogs. |
| Cats | LOW | Very well tolerated when using CAT-SPECIFIC products. Cats are more prone to licking and may show more drooling. Do not use products containing permethrin on cats (some combination products like K9 Advantix contain permethrin and are for dogs only). |
| Birds | LOW | Low toxicity to birds based on available data. |
| Small Mammals | LOW | Imidacloprid is approved for use on rabbits and ferrets at appropriate doses. It is the only flea product authorized for rabbits in many countries. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Limited toxicity data exists for reptiles. Studies on Chinese lizards (Eremias argus) documented neurotoxic effects and gonadal damage at experimental doses. Neonicotinoids are designed to bind more strongly to insect receptors than vertebrate receptors, resulting in lower toxicity to reptiles compared to insects. However, reptile-specific research is limited. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian if significant exposure occurs. |

### NSAIDs (Ibuprofen, Naproxen & Veterinary NSAIDs)

**UUID:** `aa112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeef0`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** NSAID, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, pain reliever, pain killer, painkiller, ibuprofen, Advil, Motrin, Nuprin, Midol, Caldolor, IBU, Ibuprin, Ibuprohm, Medipren, Profen, Rufen, Tab-Profen, Combunox, Duexis, Vicoprofen, Neoprofen, Sine-Aid IB, naproxen, naproxen sodium, Aleve, Naprosyn, Anaprox, Naprelan, Treximet, Vimovo, Equiproxen, carprofen, Rimadyl, Novox, Quellin, Rovera, Vetprofen, Truprofen, Carpaquin, Carprieve, Norocarp, meloxicam, Metacam, Mobic, Loxicom, Meloxidyl, Meloxivet, Orocam, Rheumocam, Acticam, Animeloxan, Flexicam, Melosus, Meloxoral, Novem, deracoxib, Deramaxx, firocoxib, Previcox, Equioxx, robenacoxib, Onsior, ketoprofen, Orudis, Oruvail, Actron, Ketofen, Nexcede, piroxicam, Feldene, indomethacin, Indocin, Tivorbex, diclofenac, Voltaren, Cataflam, Cambia, Zipsor, Zorvolex, Flector, Pennsaid, Solaraze, Arthrotec, Surpass, celecoxib, Celebrex, etodolac, Lodine, EtoGesic, nabumetone, Relafen, oxaprozin, Daypro, sulindac, Clinoril, tolmetin, Tolectin, fenoprofen, Nalfon, flurbiprofen, Ansaid, meclofenamic acid, mefenamic acid, Ponstel, diflunisal, Dolobid, ketorolac, Toradol, Acular, Sprix, tepoxalin, Zubrin, mavacoxib, Trocoxil, flunixin, Banamine, phenylbutazone, bute, Butazolidin, vedaprofen, Quadrisol, tolfenamic acid, Tolfedine, dog ate Advil, dog ate ibuprofen, dog ate Aleve, cat ate ibuprofen, dog ate Rimadyl, dog ate too much Rimadyl, pet ate pain medicine, dog got into pain pills, chewable pain medicine

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs are frequently affected due to their willingness to eat found medications and chewable veterinary NSAIDs; German Shepherds may be more sensitive; GI ulceration typically seen first, followed by kidney injury at higher doses; veterinary chewable NSAIDs (Rimadyl, Deramaxx, Previcox) are common sources because dogs may consume entire bottles |
| Cats | SEVERE | Cats are MUCH more sensitive to NSAIDs than dogs due to deficient liver glucuronidation; severe acute kidney injury can occur at doses that might only cause mild GI upset in dogs; even a single human ibuprofen tablet can be dangerous for a cat; NEVER give human NSAIDs to cats |
| Birds | HIGH | Some NSAIDs are highly toxic to birds. Diclofenac caused catastrophic vulture population declines in Asia, and deaths have been documented with ibuprofen, carprofen, and flunixin in raptors, storks, cranes, and owls. Meloxicam appears to be safer for birds when used under veterinary supervision. Contact an avian veterinarian or poison control immediately. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Small mammals including rabbits, ferrets, and guinea pigs are likely sensitive to NSAIDs given their small body size; limited toxicity data available; contact poison control for guidance |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Some NSAIDs (meloxicam) are used therapeutically in reptiles under veterinary supervision; toxicity from overdose is possible but less documented than in mammals; contact a reptile veterinarian or poison control for guidance |

### Opioids & Opiates (Pain Medications)

**UUID:** `00778899-aabb-ccdd-eeff-001122334455`

**Entry Severity:** HIGH

*(Also in: Recreational Substances)*

**Alternate Names:** opioid, opiate, narcotic, pain pill, pain medication, painkiller, prescription painkiller, morphine, MS Contin, Kadian, Roxanol, heroin, codeine, Tylenol with codeine, Tylenol #3, Tylenol #4, codeine cough syrup, promethazine with codeine, hydrocodone, Vicodin, Norco, Lortab, Lorcet, Hycodan, Tussigon, Vicoprofen, oxycodone, OxyContin, Percocet, Percodan, Roxicodone, Endocet, hydromorphone, Dilaudid, Exalgo, oxymorphone, Opana, Numorphan, fentanyl, fentanyl patch, Duragesic, Duragesic patch, Actiq, Sublimaze, transdermal fentanyl, tramadol, Ultram, ConZip, Ultracet, Rybix, Ryzolt, methadone, Dolophine, Methadose, meperidine, Demerol, buprenorphine, Buprenex, Suboxone, Subutex, Butrans, butorphanol, Torbutrol, Torbugesic, Stadol, pentazocine, Talwin, tapentadol, Nucynta, loperamide, Imodium, Imodium AD, Anti-Diarrheal, Diamode, diphenoxylate, Lomotil, Logen, Lonox, illicit fentanyl, street fentanyl, fentanyl powder, kratom, Mitragyna speciosa, mitragynine, dog ate Vicodin, dog ate Percocet, dog ate OxyContin, dog chewed fentanyl patch, dog ate Imodium, cat ate pain pill, dog ate tramadol, dog ate Norco, pet ate opioid, dog ate cough syrup, collie ate Imodium

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs typically develop CNS depression, sedation, ataxia, and respiratory depression. Pinpoint pupils are characteristic. MDR1/ABCB1 mutation breeds (Collies, Australian Shepherds, Shetland Sheepdogs, Border Collies, Old English Sheepdogs, Longhaired Whippets, Silken Windhounds) are at extreme risk for severe neurological toxicity from loperamide (Imodium) and other opioids â even small amounts can be life-threatening. Fentanyl patch ingestion is a medical emergency. Tramadol combined with antidepressants risks serotonin syndrome. |
| Cats | HIGH | Cats often show CNS EXCITATION (agitation, excitement, restlessness) rather than depression â this paradoxical reaction is important for owners to recognize. Cats may have dilated rather than pinpoint pupils. Due to glucuronidation deficiency, opioid effects may be prolonged. CRITICAL: Many opioid products contain acetaminophen (Percocet, Vicodin, Tylenol #3), which is extremely toxic to cats and can be fatal. Loperamide can cause severe excitatory behavior in cats and is not recommended. |
| Birds | HIGH | Birds are highly sensitive to opioids. Respiratory depression is particularly dangerous in species with limited respiratory reserve. Contact an avian veterinarian or poison control immediately for any opioid exposure. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Small body size means even small amounts can cause significant toxicity. Rabbits and rodents are sensitive to opioid effects including respiratory depression. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian or poison control immediately. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Opioids are sometimes used therapeutically in reptile medicine, but overdose can cause significant sedation and respiratory depression. Metabolism varies by species and environmental temperature. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian for guidance. |

### Pesticides & Insecticides

**UUID:** `c9d0e1f2-3a4b-5c6d-e7f8-9a0b1c2d3e4f`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Informational, Garage & Garden)*

**Alternate Names:** pesticide, insecticide, bug killer, bug spray, flea product poisoning, tick product poisoning, flea medicine toxicity, garden pesticide, lawn insecticide, ant killer, roach killer, wasp spray, insect poison

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Risk varies by pesticide type. Dogs generally tolerate most modern flea products well. Main concerns are organophosphates (HIGH risk) and accidental massive ingestion of any product. |
| Cats | SEVERE | CATS ARE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO PYRETHROIDS (especially permethrin). Never use dog flea products on cats. Keep cats separated from treated dogs for 72 hours. Other modern flea products (imidacloprid, fipronil) are generally safe for cats. |
| Birds | HIGH | Birds are sensitive to many pesticides, particularly fipronil and organophosphates. Avoid using pesticide sprays around birds. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | FIPRONIL IS DANGEROUS TO RABBITS. Use only imidacloprid-based products on rabbits. Small body size increases risk for all pesticide types. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Toxicity varies by pesticide type. Pyrethroids and organophosphates pose the greatest risk. Limited clinical data for reptiles â contact a reptile-experienced veterinarian for any pesticide exposure. |

### Phenylpropanolamine (PPA)

**UUID:** `99aa7788-bbcc-ddee-ff00-112233445566`

**Entry Severity:** HIGH

**Alternate Names:** phenylpropanolamine, PPA, Proin, Proin ER, Propalin, Cystolamine, Uricon, Uriflex-PT, Urilin, urinary incontinence medication, incontinence pills, bladder control medication, dog ate Proin, dog ate incontinence pills, dog ate whole bottle of Proin, pet ate bladder medication, dog got into incontinence medicine

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | PPA is commonly prescribed for dogs with urinary incontinence â toxicosis occurs with overdose or in sensitive individuals. Some dogs may show signs even at therapeutic doses. Older dogs and those with pre-existing heart disease, hypertension, kidney disease, or diabetes may be more sensitive. The CHEWABLE TABLETS are palatable â dogs have consumed entire bottles by chewing through vials. Severe cases can be life-threatening and require immediate veterinary intervention. |
| Cats | HIGH | PPA toxicosis is rarely reported in cats, possibly because it is uncommonly prescribed for felines and cats are more discriminating eaters. When it does occur, common signs include vomiting, retching, hypertension, and rapid breathing. Any PPA ingestion by a cat should be evaluated by a veterinarian. |
| Birds | HIGH | No specific data available. Birds are sensitive to cardiovascular stressors. Contact an avian veterinarian immediately for any suspected ingestion. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | No specific data available. Small body size increases risk of significant effects. Sympathomimetic drugs can cause serious cardiovascular effects in small mammals. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian or poison control immediately. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Very limited data. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian for guidance. |

### Pyrethrins & Pyrethroids (Permethrin)

**UUID:** `d4e5f6a7-8b9c-4d0e-a1b2-3c4d5e6f7a8b`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

*(Also in: Garage & Garden)*

**Alternate Names:** permethrin, pyrethrin, pyrethroid, flea treatment poisoning, flea product toxicity, spot-on poisoning, flea collar toxicosis, flea dip toxicosis, flea spray toxicosis, tick treatment poisoning, dog flea product on cat, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, allethrin, bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, cyhalothrin, cyphenothrin, etofenprox, fenvalerate, flumethrin, fluvalinate, phenothrin, resmethrin, sumithrin, tetramethrin, tefluthrin, tralomethrin, Advantix, K9 Advantix, Bio Spot, Hartz flea, Sentry flea, Zodiac flea, Sergeant's flea, Adams flea, chrysanthemum insecticide

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | LOW | Dogs tolerate pyrethroids well when used according to label directions. Toxicosis is rare but can occur with significant overdose (large-dog product on small puppy), ingestion of flea collars, or ingestion of large amounts of yard/garden products. Very young or very small dogs may be more susceptible. |
| Cats | SEVERE | EXTREMELY SENSITIVE. Cats lack the liver enzymes to efficiently metabolize pyrethroids. Over 96% of cats exposed to concentrated products develop toxic signs. Dog flea products should NEVER be applied to cats. Cats should also be separated from treated dogs for 72 hours after application. |
| Birds | LOW | Birds generally have low sensitivity to pyrethrins and pyrethroids. However, products should still be used according to label directions and birds should not be exposed to concentrated applications. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Small mammals including rabbits and guinea pigs can be affected by pyrethrin and pyrethroid toxicity. Studies show rabbits exposed to high doses exhibited tremors, convulsions, liver damage, and kidney effects. While mammals are generally less sensitive than cats (which have deficient glucuronidation), small body size increases risk. Ferrets may be more sensitive due to their carnivorous metabolism. Contact a veterinarian or poison control if exposure occurs. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Reptiles can be safely treated with pyrethrin/pyrethroid products for parasites when used correctly, but care must be taken to avoid the eyes and mouth. Excessive exposure can cause toxicosis. Fish in the same environment are extremely sensitive and may die from minimal exposure. |

**Entry Severity:** MODERATE

**Alternate Names:** sleep aid, sleeping pill, sleeping pills, sleep medicine, insomnia medication, sedative, hypnotic, Z-drug, zolpidem, Ambien, Ambien CR, Edluar, Intermezzo, Zolpimist, eszopiclone, Lunesta, zaleplon, Sonata, diphenhydramine, Benadryl, ZzzQuil, Sominex, Nytol, Unisom SleepGels, Simply Sleep, Compoz, Sleep-eze, Sleepinal, Banophen, Diphenhist, Vetadryl, Genahist, Tylenol PM, Advil PM, Excedrin PM, Aleve PM, Motrin PM, NyQuil, ZzzQuil PURE Zzzs, doxylamine, Unisom SleepTabs, Unisom, Restavit, dimenhydrinate, Dramamine, dog ate Ambien, dog ate sleeping pill, cat ate Ambien, dog ate Benadryl, dog ate ZzzQuil, dog ate Tylenol PM, pet ate sleep medication, dog ate Lunesta, dog ate Unisom

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Dogs frequently develop paradoxical CNS stimulation (40-50%) rather than sedation â agitation, hyperactivity, aggression, and tremors may occur instead of drowsiness. Healthy, non-geriatric adults are most prone to this reaction. CRITICAL: If the product contains acetaminophen (Tylenol PM) or ibuprofen (Advil PM), the risk is significantly higher â identify the exact product immediately. |
| Cats | HIGH | Cats can also experience paradoxical excitement. More importantly, many combination sleep aids contain ACETAMINOPHEN (Tylenol PM, some NyQuil products), which is extremely toxic to cats and can cause fatal methemoglobinemia and liver failure. Always verify the product does NOT contain acetaminophen before assuming 'sleep aid' toxicity only. Pure diphenhydramine is sometimes used therapeutically in cats but overdose can cause significant signs. |
| Birds | MODERATE | Limited data on sleep aid toxicity in birds. Sedation and respiratory depression possible. Contact an avian veterinarian or poison control. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Limited toxicity data available. Small body size increases risk of significant effects. Sedation, ataxia, and anticholinergic effects expected. Contact poison control for species-specific guidance. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Very limited data available. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian for guidance. |

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | LOW | Dogs have a WIDE margin of safety for levothyroxine. Single acute overdose is typically not dangerous â dogs tolerated 3-6x recommended doses daily for 4 weeks without toxicosis. More common concern is chronic overdose causing thyrotoxicosis.\n\nNOTE: Some dogs are allergic to the dye in colored tablets â signs include itching, dermatitis, and GI upset. Undyed formulations are available. |
| Cats | LOW | Cats generally tolerate levothyroxine well. Acute overdose toxicosis is uncommon. Cats typically take doses closer to human doses than dogs do. Contact your veterinarian if your cat ingests levothyroxine intended for a human or another pet, especially in large amounts. |
| Birds | MODERATE | Limited data in birds. Thyroid hormone metabolism differs across species. Contact an avian veterinarian for guidance. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Limited data in small mammals. Small body size may increase sensitivity. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian for guidance on accidental ingestion. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Very limited data. Reptile thyroid physiology differs from mammals. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian for guidance. |

### Expanding Glues (Gorilla Glue)

**UUID:** `b2e4f7a1-8c3d-4e6f-a9b2-1d5c8e3f7a2b`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Informational)*

**Alternate Names:** Gorilla Glue, polyurethane glue, expanding glue, foaming glue, wood glue, construction glue, diisocyanate glue, isocyanate glue, Elmer's ProBond, Titebond polyurethane, expanding adhesive, foaming adhesive, polyurethane adhesive, Grizzly glue, expanding wood glue, Loctite polyurethane, MDI glue, diphenylmethane diisocyanate

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs are overwhelmingly the most commonly affected species, typically from chewing on glue bottles. The sweet smell and taste of these products attracts dogs. Surgery is almost always required to remove the hardened mass. |
| Cats | HIGH | Expanding glue ingestion has not been reported in cats in the veterinary literature, but the same mechanism would apply if a cat ingested the product. Cats may be exposed if they groom glue off their fur. |
| Birds | HIGH | No documented cases, but exposure is theoretically possible if a bird chews on a glue bottle or walks through fresh glue. The expanding mechanism would cause crop or GI obstruction. Birds can regurgitate but may not be able to expel hardened material. Additionally, fumes from these products can cause respiratory irritation in birds. The risk is mechanical obstruction, not chemical toxicity. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | No documented cases, but the same obstruction mechanism applies. Ferrets are particularly at risk as they commonly chew on rubber and foam objects. Rabbits and rodents cannot vomit to expel the material. Small body size means even tiny amounts could cause complete obstruction. GI surgery in small mammals carries higher risk than in dogs. Seek immediate veterinary care for any suspected ingestion. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | No documented cases and exposure is unlikely given reptile behavior and diet. However, if ingested, the same expanding/hardening mechanism could cause GI obstruction. Reptiles kept free-roaming in homes may have higher exposure risk. Limited data available; avoid any exposure as a precaution. |

### Fertilizers

**UUID:** `c3f5a8b2-7d4e-4f1a-b6c9-2e8d7f4a5b3c`

**Entry Severity:** MODERATE

**Alternate Names:** lawn fertilizer, garden fertilizer, plant food, plant fertilizer, bone meal, blood meal, fish meal, feather meal, organic fertilizer, rose fertilizer, Miracle-Gro, Scotts fertilizer, lawn food, garden soil, potting soil with fertilizer, slow release fertilizer, granular fertilizer, liquid fertilizer, NPK fertilizer, nitrogen fertilizer, iron fertilizer, compost fertilizer, weed and feed, weed & feed

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Dogs are most commonly affected because they find organic fertilizers (bone meal, blood meal) highly palatable and will often eat large quantities directly from bags. Risk increases significantly with combination products containing organophosphates. |
| Cats | LOW | Cats are less commonly affected as they are typically less interested in eating fertilizers. However, they can be exposed by walking through treated areas and grooming their paws. |
| Birds | MODERATE | Birds may be exposed to fertilizers in outdoor environments. Small body size increases risk from smaller exposures. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Rabbits, guinea pigs, and other small mammals face similar GI risks. Bone meal poses obstruction risk. Small body size means smaller amounts can cause problems. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Reptiles are unlikely to consume fertilizers directly. Risk mainly from contaminated water sources or substrate. Contact a reptile-experienced veterinarian if exposure occurs. |

### Fipronil (Frontline)

**UUID:** `a7b8c9d0-1e2f-4a3b-c4d5-6e7f8a9b0c1d`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

*(Also in: Medications)*

**Alternate Names:** fipronil, Frontline, Frontline Plus, Frontline Gold, Frontline Spray, phenylpyrazole, flea treatment toxicity, dog licked Frontline, cat licked Frontline, fipronil poisoning, spot-on flea medicine, pyriprole

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | LOW | Very well tolerated. Dogs given 5 times the topical dose or 0.5 mg/kg/day orally for 13 weeks showed no adverse effects. Main concern is taste reaction from licking. Safe for pregnant and nursing dogs. |
| Cats | LOW | Very well tolerated at label doses. Cats given 5 times the topical dose showed no adverse effects. Do not use on kittens under 8 weeks of age. |
| Birds | HIGH | Birds are significantly more sensitive to fipronil than mammals. Oral LD50 values are 31 mg/kg in pheasants and 11.3 mg/kg in bobwhite quail (compared to 97 mg/kg in rats). Keep pet birds away from treated animals. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | â ï¸ DANGEROUS TO RABBITS. Fipronil has been associated with deaths in rabbits and should NEVER be used on them. Use imidacloprid-based products (Advantage) for rabbits instead. |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Fipronil is documented as highly toxic to reptiles, particularly lizards. Research shows an LD50 of just 30 micrograms per gram body weight in lacertid lizards. A green iguana death has been reported from fipronil exposure. Studies on bearded dragons showed fipronil reduced activity by nearly 50% and the toxin persisted in blood for over 4 weeks. Reptiles have lower cytochrome P450 activity, impairing their ability to clear the toxin. Never use fipronil-containing flea products near reptile enclosures. Seek immediate veterinary care if exposure occurs. |

### Heavy Metal Toxicosis (Lead, Zinc, Copper & Others)

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef23`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Informational, Household Items)*

**Alternate Names:** heavy metal poisoning, heavy metal toxicity, metal poisoning, plumbism, lead poisoning, zinc toxicosis, zinc poisoning, copper toxicosis, copper poisoning, new wire disease, galvanized wire disease

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Young dogs (<2 years) most commonly affected. Dogs absorb lead readily regardless of age. Small dogs are at higher risk for zinc toxicosis from pennies because objects may lodge in stomach rather than passing through. Certain breeds (Bedlington Terrier, Labrador Retriever, West Highland White Terrier) have genetic predisposition to copper accumulation. |
| Cats | HIGH | Less common due to discriminating eating habits. Often exposed through grooming lead-contaminated dust/paint during home renovation. Vomiting, seizures, and anorexia are common signs. Lead is one of few causes of intermittent seizures in cats. |
| Birds | SEVERE | MOST SUSCEPTIBLE SPECIES. Heavy metal toxicosis is the most commonly reported toxic disease in companion birds. Birds chew on cage hardware, toys, and jewelry out of curiosity. 'New wire disease' (chronic zinc toxicosis from galvanized cages) is common but underdiagnosed. Neurological signs may be permanent even after treatment. Use only stainless steel cages and accessories. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Documented in rabbits, ferrets, and guinea pigs. Rabbits may present with GI stasis (stopped gut movement) rather than obvious toxicity signsâinvestigate for heavy metal exposure in any rabbit with unexplained GI stasis. Ferrets can develop GI bleeding and kidney injury from zinc. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Less commonly reported, but zinc toxicosis documented in turtles and crocodilians from coin ingestion. Lead toxicosis documented in red-eared sliders and other species.\n\nNote: Snakes naturally have very high blood zinc levels (5-50 times mammalian normal), so blood tests must be interpreted carefully by a veterinarian familiar with reptile medicine. |

### Lead (Batteries, Paint, Fishing Weights)

**UUID:** `3b605ff6-df0c-426f-8687-70226969f7c0`

**Entry Severity:** HIGH

**Alternate Names:** lead poisoning, lead toxicosis, plumbism, heavy metal poisoning, lead-acid battery, car battery, automotive battery, battery acid, lead-based paint, paint chips, paint dust, renovation dust, fishing sinker, fishing weight, lead sinker, split shot, curtain weight, drapery weight, wheel weight, tire weight, lead shot, ammunition, bullets, pellets, bird shot, buckshot, solder, soldering, plumbing solder, lead pipe, golf ball, golf balls, stained glass, ceramic glaze, imported toys, lead figurines, lead weights, costume jewelry, children's jewelry, cheap jewelry, candle wick, lead wick, leaded crystal, crystal bowl, pewter, antique pewter

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs are most commonly affected, especially those under 2 years old. Dogs absorb lead readily at any age (unlike most species where young animals absorb more). Chewing behavior increases exposure risk. GI and neurological signs are most common. |
| Cats | HIGH | Less common than in dogs â cats are more fastidious and less likely to chew on objects or lick painted surfaces. However, cats can be exposed through grooming dust from renovations. Lead is one of few causes of intermittent seizures in cats. |
| Birds | HIGH | Birds are highly susceptible to lead poisoning. Common sources include lead weights, stained glass solder, and older cages with lead-based paint or lead components. Wild birds may ingest lead shot from the environment. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Small mammals can be exposed through chewing on lead-containing objects or ingesting contaminated materials. Their small body size makes even small exposures potentially serious. |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Lead toxicity documented in reptiles including turtles, lizards, and snakes. A case study in a red-eared slider showed blood lead levels of 851 Âµg/dL. Lead causes neurological signs, lethargy, and organ damage. Small body size means even small exposures can be significant. |

### Neonicotinoids (Imidacloprid)

**UUID:** `f6a7b8c9-0d1e-4f2a-b3c4-5d6e7f8a9b0c`

**Entry Severity:** LOW-MODERATE

*(Also in: Medications)*

**Alternate Names:** imidacloprid, neonicotinoid, Advantage, Advantage II, Advantage Multi, Advocate, Seresto, K9 Advantix, flea treatment licked, cat licked flea medicine, dog licked flea treatment, spot-on flea treatment, dinotefuran, nitenpyram, Capstar, clothianidin, acetamiprid, thiamethoxam, thiacloprid

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | LOW | Very well tolerated. Dogs given 5 times the topical dose or 41 mg/kg/day orally for one year showed no adverse effects. Main concern is taste reaction from licking. Safe for pregnant and nursing dogs. |
| Cats | LOW | Very well tolerated when using CAT-SPECIFIC products. Cats are more prone to licking and may show more drooling. Do not use products containing permethrin on cats (some combination products like K9 Advantix contain permethrin and are for dogs only). |
| Birds | LOW | Low toxicity to birds based on available data. |
| Small Mammals | LOW | Imidacloprid is approved for use on rabbits and ferrets at appropriate doses. It is the only flea product authorized for rabbits in many countries. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Limited toxicity data exists for reptiles. Studies on Chinese lizards (Eremias argus) documented neurotoxic effects and gonadal damage at experimental doses. Neonicotinoids are designed to bind more strongly to insect receptors than vertebrate receptors, resulting in lower toxicity to reptiles compared to insects. However, reptile-specific research is limited. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian if significant exposure occurs. |

### Organophosphates & Carbamates

**UUID:** `e5f6a7b8-9c0d-4e1f-b2a3-4c5d6e7f8a9b`

**Entry Severity:** HIGH

**Alternate Names:** organophosphate, organophosphate poisoning, carbamate, carbamate poisoning, cholinesterase inhibitor, acetylcholinesterase poisoning, SLUDGE syndrome, systemic rose care, rose fertilizer poison, disulfoton, Di-Syston, acephate, Orthene, chlorpyrifos, Dursban, Lorsban, diazinon, malathion, parathion, phosmet, dichlorvos, DDVP, fenthion, coumaphos, terbufos, carbaryl, Sevin, carbofuran, Furadan, methomyl, Lannate, propoxur, Baygon, aldicarb, Temik, fly bait poisoning, cattle ear tag poisoning, livestock ear tag

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs are frequently poisoned by ingesting rose care products mixed with attractive fertilizers (bone meal, blood meal), fly baits, or cattle ear tags. In one study of 102 dogs, 17% died despite treatment. Signs associated with death included weakness, mental dullness, and respiratory failure. |
| Cats | HIGH | Cats are particularly sensitive to many OPs, especially chlorpyrifos. Exposure often occurs through grooming after walking through treated areas or from topical flea products. Cats may show chronic toxicosis from fat-stored OPs. Muscarinic signs (SLUDGE) are often LESS prominent in cats. One study reported 15% mortality. |
| Birds | HIGH | Birds are highly susceptible to organophosphates and carbamates. Carbofuran (Furadan) is extremely toxic to birds â even tiny amounts can be fatal to poultry, ducks, pheasants, and wild birds. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Small mammals are highly susceptible due to their small body size. Cholinesterase-inhibiting pesticides affect all mammals. Any exposure warrants immediate veterinary care. |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Reptiles have acetylcholinesterase and are susceptible to these toxins. Limited clinical data exists, but the mechanism of toxicity applies across vertebrates. Contact a reptile-experienced veterinarian for any exposure. |

### Paints (Latex, Oil-Based, & Spray Paints)

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef02`

**Entry Severity:** LOW

**Alternate Names:** latex paint, acrylic paint, water-based paint, oil-based paint, oil paint, alkyd paint, enamel paint, spray paint, aerosol paint, house paint, wall paint, interior paint, exterior paint, craft paint, artist paint, tempera paint, poster paint, finger paint, paint fumes, wet paint, dried paint, paint on fur, paint on paws, dog ate paint, cat ate paint, dog stepped in paint

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | LOW | Latex and water-based paints typically cause only mild GI upset. Oil-based paints carry aspiration risk. Lead paint (pre-1978) is a serious concern requiring veterinary evaluation. Do not use solvents to remove paint from fur. |
| Cats | LOW | Same as dogs. Cats may groom paint off their fur â dried latex paint is generally safe to ingest in small amounts during grooming, but large amounts or oil-based paints warrant concern. Never use solvents on cats. |
| Birds | MODERATE | Birds are highly sensitive to fumes from oil-based and spray paints. Ensure excellent ventilation if painting near birds, or relocate them temporarily. Even 'low-VOC' paints can irritate avian respiratory systems. |
| Small Mammals | LOW | Similar to dogs and cats; mild GI upset expected with latex paints. Respiratory sensitivity to fumes may be higher. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Limited information; GI effects expected if ingested. Ensure good ventilation in enclosure areas. |

### Petroleum Products (Gasoline, Motor Oil, Diesel)

**UUID:** `edfcb0ed-52aa-44fb-a71f-060551350513`

**Entry Severity:** HIGH

**Alternate Names:** gasoline, gas, petrol, motor oil, engine oil, car oil, used motor oil, diesel, diesel fuel, kerosene, kerosine, paraffin oil, lamp oil, tiki torch fuel, lighter fluid, charcoal lighter, paint thinner, paint solvent, mineral spirits, turpentine, petroleum distillates, hydrocarbons, crude oil, heating oil, fuel oil, jet fuel, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, transmission fluid, gear oil, hydraulic fluid, penetrating oil, WD-40, lubricating oil, grease, automotive grease, wood stain, wood stripper, asphalt, roofing tar, Castrol, Mobil 1, Valvoline, Pennzoil, Quaker State

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Severity depends on product type: gasoline/kerosene exposure is HIGH risk; motor oil exposure is MODERATE risk. Dogs may ingest petroleum products from spills or by chewing containers. Aspiration pneumonia is the primary concern with volatile products. |
| Cats | HIGH | Cats are frequently exposed through grooming contaminated fur. Even small amounts of gasoline on fur can cause irritation; prompt bathing with dish soap is important. Respiratory signs warrant immediate veterinary evaluation. |
| Birds | HIGH | Birds are extremely sensitive to inhaled fumes. Keep birds away from areas where petroleum products are used or stored. Even fume exposure without direct contact can be dangerous. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Small mammals including rabbits, guinea pigs, and ferrets can be affected by petroleum product exposure through ingestion or skin contact. Aspiration pneumonia is a serious risk if volatile products like gasoline are involved. If petroleum gets on fur, bathe with dish soap (like Dawn) and contact a veterinarian. Small body size increases risk from even minor exposures. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Reptiles can be affected by petroleum product exposure, particularly through skin contact. Research on sea turtles and iguanas has documented toxic effects from oil exposure. Remove any petroleum contamination from skin and contact an exotic animal veterinarian. |

### Pyrethrins & Pyrethroids (Permethrin)

**UUID:** `d4e5f6a7-8b9c-4d0e-a1b2-3c4d5e6f7a8b`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

*(Also in: Medications)*

**Alternate Names:** permethrin, pyrethrin, pyrethroid, flea treatment poisoning, flea product toxicity, spot-on poisoning, flea collar toxicosis, flea dip toxicosis, flea spray toxicosis, tick treatment poisoning, dog flea product on cat, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, allethrin, bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, cyhalothrin, cyphenothrin, etofenprox, fenvalerate, flumethrin, fluvalinate, phenothrin, resmethrin, sumithrin, tetramethrin, tefluthrin, tralomethrin, Advantix, K9 Advantix, Bio Spot, Hartz flea, Sentry flea, Zodiac flea, Sergeant's flea, Adams flea, chrysanthemum insecticide

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | LOW | Dogs tolerate pyrethroids well when used according to label directions. Toxicosis is rare but can occur with significant overdose (large-dog product on small puppy), ingestion of flea collars, or ingestion of large amounts of yard/garden products. Very young or very small dogs may be more susceptible. |
| Cats | SEVERE | EXTREMELY SENSITIVE. Cats lack the liver enzymes to efficiently metabolize pyrethroids. Over 96% of cats exposed to concentrated products develop toxic signs. Dog flea products should NEVER be applied to cats. Cats should also be separated from treated dogs for 72 hours after application. |
| Birds | LOW | Birds generally have low sensitivity to pyrethrins and pyrethroids. However, products should still be used according to label directions and birds should not be exposed to concentrated applications. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Small mammals including rabbits and guinea pigs can be affected by pyrethrin and pyrethroid toxicity. Studies show rabbits exposed to high doses exhibited tremors, convulsions, liver damage, and kidney effects. While mammals are generally less sensitive than cats (which have deficient glucuronidation), small body size increases risk. Ferrets may be more sensitive due to their carnivorous metabolism. Contact a veterinarian or poison control if exposure occurs. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Reptiles can be safely treated with pyrethrin/pyrethroid products for parasites when used correctly, but care must be taken to avoid the eyes and mouth. Excessive exposure can cause toxicosis. Fish in the same environment are extremely sensitive and may die from minimal exposure. |

### Salt

**UUID:** `c9fb21d1-a66a-418e-a63f-1b754ec048f2`

**Entry Severity:** HIGH

*(Also in: Foods)*

**Alternate Names:** sodium chloride, table salt, rock salt, de-icing salt, road salt, sea salt, homemade play dough, salt dough, playdough, paint balls, sea water, ocean water, salty snacks, ice melt, ice melter, ice melt pellets, de-icer, deicer, sidewalk salt, driveway salt, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, Safe Paw, Safe Step, Morton Safe-T-Salt, Road Runner ice melt, pet safe ice melt, pet friendly ice melt

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs are frequently affected due to eating play dough, de-icing salt, or drinking sea water at the beach |
| Cats | HIGH | Cats can develop toxicity from ocean water exposure or licking salt from surfaces |
| Birds | HIGH | Birds are also susceptible to salt toxicity |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Salt toxicity has been documented in pet rabbits. A 2020 case report in the Journal of Exotic Pet Medicine documented the first clinical case of sodium chloride toxicosis in a pet rabbit from a Himalayan salt lickâthe rabbit developed seizures, ataxia, and obtunded mentation. Guinea pigs are also at risk, and excess salt/minerals can contribute to bladder sludge and urinary stones. Never provide salt licks to rabbits or guinea pigs. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Many reptiles (iguanas, chameleons, desert species) have specialized nasal salt glands that help excrete excess sodium, providing some protection. However, reptile kidneys are less efficient than mammalian kidneys at handling sodium loads. Excessive salt intake should be avoided. Common pet reptiles should not be fed salty foods or exposed to salt products. |

### Essential Oils (Tea Tree, Pennyroyal, Eucalyptus & Others)

**UUID:** `eeff2233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** essential oil, essential oils, aromatherapy oil, diffuser oil, fragrance oil, volatile oil, pennyroyal oil, pennyroyal, pulegone, Hedeoma pulegioides, Mentha pulegium, mosquito plant, pudding grass, wintergreen oil, wintergreen, methyl salicylate, Gaultheria, clove oil, clove, eugenol, hyssop oil, hyssop, tea tree oil, tea tree, melaleuca oil, melaleuca, Melaleuca alternifolia, eucalyptus oil, eucalyptus, cineole, peppermint oil, peppermint, menthol, menthone, pine oil, pine, pinene, citrus oil, d-limonene, limonene, orange oil, lemon oil, citronella oil, citronella, lavender oil, cinnamon oil, camphor oil, camphor, rosemary oil, thyme oil, oregano oil, ylang ylang, birch oil, sweet birch, oil diffuser, reed diffuser, aromatherapy diffuser, natural flea treatment, herbal flea product, dog ate essential oil, cat essential oil diffuser, tea tree oil dog, tea tree oil cat, essential oil diffuser safe pets, natural flea spray toxic

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Toxicity varies by oil type. HIGH-TOXICITY OILS (pennyroyal, wintergreen, clove, hyssop) can cause severe effects including liver failure, seizures, and death even at low doses. Pennyroyal oil found in some 'natural' flea products has caused death within 48 hours of topical application. MEDIUM-TOXICITY OILS (tea tree, eucalyptus, peppermint) can cause CNS depression, tremors, and ataxia, especially with concentrated products. LOW-TOXICITY OILS (citrus, pine, citronella) typically cause GI upset. For any topical exposure, immediately bathe with dish soap and warm water, then seek veterinary care. |
| Cats | SEVERE | CATS ARE EXTREMELY SUSCEPTIBLE to essential oil toxicity due to deficient liver metabolism (glucuronidation and sulfation pathways). This causes prolonged activity and increased toxicity. Even diffuser exposure can be problematic â if your cat shows any signs of illness when a diffuser is running, discontinue use immediately. Topical application of essential oils to cats is especially dangerous. Tea tree oil, pennyroyal, wintergreen, eucalyptus, peppermint, and many others can cause severe toxicity. For any exposure, immediately bathe with dish soap and warm water, then seek emergency veterinary care. |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds have extremely sensitive respiratory systems. Essential oil diffusers and any aerosolized oils can cause severe respiratory distress. Never use essential oil diffusers, sprays, or heated oils in the same room as birds. Contact an avian veterinarian immediately if exposure occurs. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Small mammals including rabbits, ferrets, guinea pigs, and hamsters can be affected by essential oil exposure. Their small size makes them vulnerable to concentrated oils. Avoid using essential oils around small mammals and contact an exotic animal veterinarian if exposure occurs. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Limited data available for reptiles. Essential oils may cause respiratory irritation and other effects. Avoid using diffusers or applying oils in reptile enclosures. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian if exposure occurs. |

### Heavy Metal Toxicosis (Lead, Zinc, Copper & Others)

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef23`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Informational, Garage & Garden)*

**Alternate Names:** heavy metal poisoning, heavy metal toxicity, metal poisoning, plumbism, lead poisoning, zinc toxicosis, zinc poisoning, copper toxicosis, copper poisoning, new wire disease, galvanized wire disease

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Young dogs (<2 years) most commonly affected. Dogs absorb lead readily regardless of age. Small dogs are at higher risk for zinc toxicosis from pennies because objects may lodge in stomach rather than passing through. Certain breeds (Bedlington Terrier, Labrador Retriever, West Highland White Terrier) have genetic predisposition to copper accumulation. |
| Cats | HIGH | Less common due to discriminating eating habits. Often exposed through grooming lead-contaminated dust/paint during home renovation. Vomiting, seizures, and anorexia are common signs. Lead is one of few causes of intermittent seizures in cats. |
| Birds | SEVERE | MOST SUSCEPTIBLE SPECIES. Heavy metal toxicosis is the most commonly reported toxic disease in companion birds. Birds chew on cage hardware, toys, and jewelry out of curiosity. 'New wire disease' (chronic zinc toxicosis from galvanized cages) is common but underdiagnosed. Neurological signs may be permanent even after treatment. Use only stainless steel cages and accessories. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Documented in rabbits, ferrets, and guinea pigs. Rabbits may present with GI stasis (stopped gut movement) rather than obvious toxicity signsâinvestigate for heavy metal exposure in any rabbit with unexplained GI stasis. Ferrets can develop GI bleeding and kidney injury from zinc. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Less commonly reported, but zinc toxicosis documented in turtles and crocodilians from coin ingestion. Lead toxicosis documented in red-eared sliders and other species.\n\nNote: Snakes naturally have very high blood zinc levels (5-50 times mammalian normal), so blood tests must be interpreted carefully by a veterinarian familiar with reptile medicine. |

**Alternate Names:** beer hops, brewing hops, hop cones, hop flowers, hop plugs, spent hops, lupulin, home brewing hops, homebrew hops, wort hops, dried hops, pellet hops, Humulus lupulus, Humulus

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Causes malignant hyperthermia with body temperature exceeding 109Â°F. Death can occur within 3 HOURS without treatment. Large breeds may be overrepresented but ANY dog is at risk. THIS IS AN EMERGENCYâseek immediate veterinary care. |
| Cats | LOW | Hops toxicosis has NOT been reported in cats. However, given the extreme severity in dogs, cats should also be prevented from accessing hops. |
| Birds | LOW | The malignant hyperthermia reaction from hops appears to be specific to dogs; there are no documented cases of hops toxicity in birds; small amounts of hop extract are actually used in some avian calming supplements |
| Small Mammals | LOW | Hops toxicosis has only been documented in dogs (and rarely cats); no cases have been reported in rabbits, guinea pigs, or other small mammals; hop extracts in small doses are used in some small animal calming formulations |
| Reptiles | LOW | No documented cases of hops toxicity in reptiles; the malignant hyperthermia-like reaction appears to be mammal-specific and primarily affects dogs; reptiles are unlikely to consume hops but should still be kept away as a precaution |

### Inhalant Toxicity (Birds & Respiratory Hazards)

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef24`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Informational)*

**Alternate Names:** inhalant toxicity birds, avian respiratory hazards, toxic fumes birds, bird respiratory sensitivity, air sac system birds, bird lung sensitivity, aerosol spray toxic birds, scented candle birds, air freshener birds, smoke inhalation birds, cigarette smoke birds, cooking fumes birds, carbon monoxide pets, CO poisoning pets, polymer fume fever, inhalation hazards, airborne toxins, fumes dangerous birds, bird safe home, respiratory toxicosis avian

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Vulnerable to carbon monoxide and smoke inhalation. May show CO poisoning symptoms before humans due to smaller size and time spent indoors. Watch for delayed neurological effects after any CO exposure â behavior changes, confusion, or hearing problems may develop weeks later. |
| Cats | HIGH | Similar vulnerability to dogs for carbon monoxide and smoke. Cats may be more sensitive to certain aerosolized essential oils due to their unique liver metabolism. Monitor closely for delayed neurological effects after any CO exposure. |
| Birds | SEVERE | Extremely vulnerable to virtually ALL inhalant hazards. Highly efficient air sac respiratory system absorbs toxins rapidly â PTFE fumes can kill within minutes. Even scented candles, aerosol sprays, and essential oil diffusers pose risk. If you can smell it, your bird is breathing it â and absorbing it far more efficiently than you. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Rabbits, guinea pigs, and small rodents are at significant risk from carbon monoxide and smoke due to smaller body size and higher metabolic rates. House in well-ventilated areas away from kitchens and potential fume sources. Monitor for delayed neurological effects after any CO exposure. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Limited research exists on reptile-specific inhalant sensitivity. Lower metabolic rate and slower respiration provides some protection compared to birds and mammals. However, reptiles still use hemoglobin and ARE vulnerable to carbon monoxide poisoning, smoke inhalation, and prolonged exposure to strong chemical fumes. Keep enclosures well-ventilated and away from recently cleaned areas (wait 24+ hours after using bleach or strong disinfectants). |

### Inhalant Toxins (PTFE / Teflon Toxicosis)

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef22`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** teflon toxicity, teflon poisoning, PTFE toxicosis, polytetrafluoroethylene, non-stick cookware, overheated pan, polymer fume fever, teflon fumes, toxic fumes birds, bird respiratory toxicity, self-cleaning oven, aerosol spray toxicity, smoke inhalation birds, avian inhalant toxicosis

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | LOW | PTFE (Teflon) fume toxicity is primarily a bird-specific concern. Dogs are far less sensitive to PTFE fumes due to their less efficient respiratory system. However, prolonged exposure to any smoke or chemical fumes can cause respiratory irritation. If signs of respiratory distress occur after fume exposure, seek veterinary care. |
| Cats | LOW | PTFE (Teflon) fume toxicity is primarily a bird-specific concern. Cats are far less sensitive to PTFE fumes than birds. However, prolonged exposure to smoke or chemical fumes can cause respiratory irritation. If signs of respiratory distress occur after fume exposure, seek veterinary care. |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds are extremely sensitive to inhaled toxins due to their highly efficient respiratory system. PTFE (Teflon) fumes from overheated cookware can cause death within minutesâoften before any symptoms are observed. ANY strong odor, smoke, or fumes should be considered potentially life-threatening. Never use non-stick cookware, self-cleaning ovens, or aerosol products near birds. Ensure birds are housed in well-ventilated areas away from kitchens. If exposure occurs, move the bird to fresh air IMMEDIATELY and seek emergency veterinary care. |
| Small Mammals | LOW | PTFE (Teflon) fume toxicity is primarily a bird-specific concern. Small mammals (rabbits, guinea pigs, ferrets, hamsters) are far less sensitive to PTFE fumes than birds. However, their smaller size means prolonged exposure to any smoke or chemical fumes may cause respiratory irritation more readily than in larger mammals. |
| Reptiles | LOW | PTFE (Teflon) fume toxicity is primarily a bird-specific concern. Reptiles have a much slower respiratory rate and less efficient gas exchange than birds, making them far less susceptible to acute PTFE toxicity. However, good ventilation is always recommended for reptile enclosures. |

## Recreational Substances

_8 entries in this category._

### Alcohol

**UUID:** `63f63b3a-1172-4fb2-9702-45496c99df4d`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

*(Also in: Foods)*

**Alternate Names:** ethanol, ethyl alcohol, beer, wine, liquor, spirits, vodka, whiskey, rum, cocktail, isopropanol, isopropyl alcohol, rubbing alcohol, methanol, methyl alcohol, wood alcohol, hand sanitizer

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs are highly susceptible; even small amounts can cause signs of inebriation |
| Cats | SEVERE | Cats are especially sensitive to alcohol; smaller body size increases risk |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds are highly sensitive due to small body size and rapid metabolism |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Rabbits, guinea pigs, and ferrets lack efficient alcohol metabolism. Guinea pigs have genetically lost the ADH7 enzyme for ethanol processing. Ferrets are extremely sensitive and can absorb alcohol through their skin. Small body size means rapid intoxication from even tiny amounts. Do not allow any alcohol exposure. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Ethanol causes CNS depression in reptiles and can lead to dehydration and organ damage. A study in bearded dragons showed significant metabolic and body temperature changes from ethanol exposure. Isopropyl alcohol can cause chemical burns and systemic toxicity through skin absorption. Limited research but avoid all exposure. |

*(Also in: Plants)*

**Alternate Names:** Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica, marijuana, cannabis, THC, tetrahydrocannabinol, delta-9 THC, delta-8 THC, pot, weed, grass, ganja, reefer, dope, bud, chronic, herb, skunk, Mary Jane, hashish, hash, hash oil, hemp, CBD, cannabidiol, edibles, marijuana edibles, THC edibles, THC gummies, cannabis gummies, marijuana brownies, pot brownies, cannabutter, marijuana butter, THC vape, cannabis vape, dronabinol, nabilone, devil weed, Aunt Mary, acting drunk, dog acting drunk, cat acting drunk, wobbly dog, dog stumbling

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Dogs are most commonly affected. Classic presentation: depressed/somnolent, hypothermic, bradycardic, and dribbling urine. External stimulation causes brief hyperesthesia followed by return to somnolence. With legalization, more severe cases (seizures, coma, death) are being reported â whether from more potent products or adulterants is unknown. Deaths have occurred, particularly with concentrated products or cannabutter. |
| Cats | MODERATE | Cats may show different signs than dogs, including increased locomotor activity (wandering aimlessly, spontaneous jumping), head bobbing/weaving, swaying, anxiety, aggression, polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and difficulty swallowing. Sedation and depression also occur. Seizures and coma are possible with large exposures. |
| Birds | MODERATE | Limited data available; birds are susceptible to respiratory irritants from smoke. Seek veterinary care for any suspected exposure. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Limited data available; small body size means even small exposures could cause significant effects. Seek veterinary care for any cannabis exposure in small mammals. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Reptiles have cannabinoid receptors and can be affected by THC. While limited research exists specifically for reptiles, cannabis is listed as toxic to reptiles by Reptiles Magazine. Exposure through ingestion or secondhand smoke can cause disorientation, lethargy, and respiratory distress. Tortoises and lizards should be kept away from all cannabis products. |

### Cocaine

**UUID:** `ff001122-3344-5566-7788-99aabbccdd02`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** cocaine, coke, crack, crack cocaine, freebase, rock, blow, snow, powder, white, nose candy, flake, C, cola, dust, gold dust, stardust, white girl, white lady, baseball, speedball, yayo, dog ate cocaine, cat ate cocaine, dog sniffed cocaine, dog exposed to cocaine, dog ate coke, cat ate crack, dog got into cocaine, pet ate cocaine

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | Dogs are commonly exposed to cocaine, including working police dogs during drug operations. Dogs can be exposed by sniffing contaminated surfaces â cocaine is well-absorbed through nasal and oral mucous membranes. Clinical signs develop rapidly (within minutes to 30 minutes) and include severe hyperactivity, tremors, seizures, and hyperthermia. Without treatment, the likelihood of death is high. With aggressive veterinary care, most dogs can survive. |
| Cats | SEVERE | Cats exposed to cocaine show similar severe stimulatory signs. A 2024 study found 65% of cat exposures to illicit stimulants involved cocaine (rather than methamphetamine). Cats may show severe agitation, tremors, seizures, and hyperthermia. Rapid veterinary intervention is essential. |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds are highly sensitive to stimulants. Rapid heart rate and hyperthermia are especially dangerous in avian species. Contact an avian veterinarian immediately. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Small mammals are extremely susceptible due to their small body size. Even minimal exposure can cause severe toxicity. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian immediately. |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Limited data available. Stimulant and cardiovascular effects expected. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian for guidance. |

### MDMA (Ecstasy, Molly)

**UUID:** `ff001122-3344-5566-7788-99aabbccdd03`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** MDMA, ecstasy, molly, XTC, X, E, Adam, roll, rolling, love drug, MDA, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, beans, disco biscuits, happy pill, hug drug, skittles, smarties, thizz, dog ate ecstasy, dog ate molly, cat ate ecstasy, dog ate MDMA, pet ate ecstasy pill, dog ate E, dog ate X

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | Dogs typically show hyperactivity, circling, head bobbing, tremors, dilated pupils, and rapid breathing. Serotonin syndrome can develop, causing muscle rigidity, severe hyperthermia, and seizures. Effects can last up to 72 hours because dogs metabolize MDMA slowly. When treatment is delayed, death can occur from uncontrolled seizures, hyperthermia, kidney failure, or cardiac arrhythmias. With prompt aggressive treatment, most dogs recover. |
| Cats | SEVERE | Cats exposed to MDMA may show hyperactivity OR may paradoxically hide, stare, and appear extremely withdrawn. Despite appearing outwardly calm, dangerous internal effects (elevated heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature) still occur. Cats are also more sensitive to the caffeine commonly found in ecstasy tablets. Seek immediate veterinary care regardless of outward appearance. |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds are highly sensitive to stimulants and serotonergic drugs. Hyperthermia and cardiovascular effects are especially dangerous. Contact an avian veterinarian immediately. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Small mammals are extremely susceptible due to their small body size and high metabolic rate. Serotonergic effects and hyperthermia are especially dangerous. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian immediately. |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Limited data available. Stimulant and serotonergic effects expected. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian for guidance. |

### Methamphetamine & Street Amphetamines

**UUID:** `ff001122-3344-5566-7788-99aabbccdd01`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** methamphetamine, meth, crystal meth, crystal, ice, glass, crank, speed, chalk, tina, tweak, amphetamine, amphetamines, street amphetamines, bennies, uppers, pep pills, wake-ups, black beauties, dog ate meth, cat ate meth, dog ate crystal meth, dog got into meth, pet ate speed, dog ate drugs, cat ate drugs, dog exposed to meth, dog sniffed meth

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | Dogs are commonly exposed to methamphetamine, accounting for the majority of cases reported to poison control centers. Clinical signs include severe hyperactivity, pacing, circling, tremors, seizures, and life-threatening hyperthermia. Effects can persist for 24-48 hours. With aggressive treatment, most dogs survive, but fatalities occur, especially when treatment is delayed. DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) has been reported in severe cases. |
| Cats | SEVERE | Cats are less commonly exposed than dogs but are equally susceptible to severe toxicity. Cats may show hyperactivity OR may hide, stare, and appear withdrawn while still experiencing dangerous internal cardiovascular effects. Hyperthermia and seizures can be rapidly fatal. |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds are highly sensitive to stimulants. Their high metabolic rate and limited ability to regulate body temperature make hyperthermia especially dangerous. Contact an avian veterinarian immediately. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Small mammals are extremely susceptible due to their small body size. Even minimal exposure can cause severe CNS stimulation, hyperthermia, and cardiovascular effects. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian immediately. |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Limited data available. Stimulant effects expected. Temperature regulation in reptiles depends on environmental conditions, making drug-induced changes potentially more problematic. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian. |

### Nicotine & Tobacco Products

**UUID:** `fd98d3c0-368c-4b20-9192-c98dd3c17f14`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

*(Also in: Plants)*

**Alternate Names:** nicotine, tobacco, cigarette, cigarettes, cigarette butt, cigarette butts, cigar, cigars, e-cigarette, e-cigarettes, electronic cigarette, electronic cigarettes, vape, vaping, vape juice, vape liquid, e-juice, e-liquid, e juice, e liquid, nicotine liquid, nicotine solution, nicotine patch, nicotine patches, nicotine gum, nicotine lozenge, nicotine lozenges, nicotine inhaler, nicotine nasal spray, nicotine replacement, nicotine replacement therapy, NRT, chewing tobacco, smokeless tobacco, snuff, snus, dip, dipping tobacco, pipe tobacco, Nicotiana, tobacco plant, nicotine poisoning, nicotine toxicosis, nicotine intoxication, tobacco poisoning, tobacco toxicosis, e-juice poisoning, e-liquid poisoning, ashtray, ash tray, cigarette pack, Juul, vape pen, vape pod, Nicorette, Nicoderm, Habitrol, Commit lozenge, nicotine pouch, nicotine pouches, Zyn, Zyn pouch, Zyn pouches, On!, On! pouch, Rogue, Rogue nicotine, Lucy, Lucy nicotine, oral nicotine, tobacco-free nicotine

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | Dogs are most commonly affected due to their scavenging behavior. Cigarette butts in ashtrays, discarded chewing tobacco, and e-liquids are frequent exposure sources. Nicotine gum and lozenges containing xylitol pose a double toxicity risk. Even small exposures to concentrated nicotine liquids can be rapidly fatal. |
| Cats | SEVERE | Cats are highly susceptible to nicotine toxicity. Exposure is less common than in dogs but equally dangerous. Dermal exposure can occur if cats walk through spilled e-liquids and groom themselves. |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds are highly sensitive to nicotine and respiratory irritants. Their small size and rapid metabolism make even minor exposures potentially fatal. Secondhand smoke exposure is also harmful to birds. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Rabbits, guinea pigs, ferrets, and other small mammals are extremely susceptible to nicotine toxicity due to their small body size. Even minimal exposure can be life-threatening. |
| Reptiles | SEVERE | Limited data available, but nicotine is expected to be highly toxic to reptiles. Avoid any exposure and seek veterinary care immediately if exposure occurs. |

### Opioids & Opiates (Pain Medications)

**UUID:** `00778899-aabb-ccdd-eeff-001122334455`

**Entry Severity:** HIGH

*(Also in: Medications)*

**Alternate Names:** opioid, opiate, narcotic, pain pill, pain medication, painkiller, prescription painkiller, morphine, MS Contin, Kadian, Roxanol, heroin, codeine, Tylenol with codeine, Tylenol #3, Tylenol #4, codeine cough syrup, promethazine with codeine, hydrocodone, Vicodin, Norco, Lortab, Lorcet, Hycodan, Tussigon, Vicoprofen, oxycodone, OxyContin, Percocet, Percodan, Roxicodone, Endocet, hydromorphone, Dilaudid, Exalgo, oxymorphone, Opana, Numorphan, fentanyl, fentanyl patch, Duragesic, Duragesic patch, Actiq, Sublimaze, transdermal fentanyl, tramadol, Ultram, ConZip, Ultracet, Rybix, Ryzolt, methadone, Dolophine, Methadose, meperidine, Demerol, buprenorphine, Buprenex, Suboxone, Subutex, Butrans, butorphanol, Torbutrol, Torbugesic, Stadol, pentazocine, Talwin, tapentadol, Nucynta, loperamide, Imodium, Imodium AD, Anti-Diarrheal, Diamode, diphenoxylate, Lomotil, Logen, Lonox, illicit fentanyl, street fentanyl, fentanyl powder, kratom, Mitragyna speciosa, mitragynine, dog ate Vicodin, dog ate Percocet, dog ate OxyContin, dog chewed fentanyl patch, dog ate Imodium, cat ate pain pill, dog ate tramadol, dog ate Norco, pet ate opioid, dog ate cough syrup, collie ate Imodium

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs typically develop CNS depression, sedation, ataxia, and respiratory depression. Pinpoint pupils are characteristic. MDR1/ABCB1 mutation breeds (Collies, Australian Shepherds, Shetland Sheepdogs, Border Collies, Old English Sheepdogs, Longhaired Whippets, Silken Windhounds) are at extreme risk for severe neurological toxicity from loperamide (Imodium) and other opioids â even small amounts can be life-threatening. Fentanyl patch ingestion is a medical emergency. Tramadol combined with antidepressants risks serotonin syndrome. |
| Cats | HIGH | Cats often show CNS EXCITATION (agitation, excitement, restlessness) rather than depression â this paradoxical reaction is important for owners to recognize. Cats may have dilated rather than pinpoint pupils. Due to glucuronidation deficiency, opioid effects may be prolonged. CRITICAL: Many opioid products contain acetaminophen (Percocet, Vicodin, Tylenol #3), which is extremely toxic to cats and can be fatal. Loperamide can cause severe excitatory behavior in cats and is not recommended. |
| Birds | HIGH | Birds are highly sensitive to opioids. Respiratory depression is particularly dangerous in species with limited respiratory reserve. Contact an avian veterinarian or poison control immediately for any opioid exposure. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Small body size means even small amounts can cause significant toxicity. Rabbits and rodents are sensitive to opioid effects including respiratory depression. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian or poison control immediately. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Opioids are sometimes used therapeutically in reptile medicine, but overdose can cause significant sedation and respiratory depression. Metabolism varies by species and environmental temperature. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian for guidance. |

### Psilocybin Mushrooms & Psychedelic Edibles

**UUID:** `ff001122-3344-5566-7788-99aabbccdd04`

**Entry Severity:** HIGH

**Alternate Names:** psilocybin, psilocin, magic mushrooms, shrooms, mushroom edibles, mushroom chocolate, mushroom gummies, psychedelic mushrooms, hallucinogenic mushrooms, Psilocybe, Psilocybe cubensis, liberty caps, golden teachers, penis envy mushrooms, caps, boomers, zoomers, fungi, blue meanies, mushroom bar, shroom chocolate, psilocybin chocolate, mushroom candy, microdose, microdosing, 4-AcO-DMT, synthetic psilocybin, psilacetin, Amanita muscaria, fly agaric, muscimol, ibotenic acid, amanita edibles, amanita gummies, amanita chocolate, legal mushroom edibles, legal shroom gummies, dog ate mushroom chocolate, dog ate shrooms, cat ate magic mushrooms, dog ate mushroom gummy, dog ate psychedelic mushrooms, pet ate shroom chocolate, dog ate mushroom edible

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Dogs exposed to genuine psilocybin typically experience an unpleasant but survivable intoxication. They appear distressed, disoriented, and anxious â clearly not enjoying the experience. Signs include vocalization, hyperesthesia, ataxia, mydriasis, and apprehension. Most dogs recover fully within 6-12 hours with supportive care. MISLABELED PRODUCTS: If the product contained muscimol/ibotenic acid (Amanita compounds), 4-AcO-DMT, or unknown research chemicals, the clinical presentation and severity may be unpredictable. Seizures are more likely with ibotenic acid. Always inform your veterinarian if the source was an edible product rather than actual mushrooms. |
| Cats | MODERATE | Cats exposed to psilocybin may show disorientation, dilated pupils, ataxia, and agitation. Some cats may begin frantically grooming themselves. Less clinical data exists for cats than dogs, but a similar clinical course is expected.\n\nNote: Amanita muscaria toxins (muscimol) can be more dangerous in cats. If the ingested product was an edible that may have been mislabeled, inform your veterinarian immediately. |
| Birds | HIGH | Limited data on psilocybin toxicity in birds. Altered mentation and serotonergic effects could be dangerous. Contact an avian veterinarian immediately. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Small mammals are more susceptible due to their small body size. Hallucinogenic effects and altered mentation can be especially distressing. Unknown adulterants in edible products pose additional risks. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian immediately. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Very limited data available. Serotonergic effects expected but severity is unknown. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian for guidance. |

### Asp/Puss Caterpillar & Stinging Caterpillars

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef12`

**Entry Severity:** MODERATE

**Alternate Names:** puss caterpillar, puss moth caterpillar, asp caterpillar, southern flannel moth caterpillar, flannel moth caterpillar, tree asp, woolly slug, Italian asp, possum bug, el perrito, saddleback caterpillar, slug caterpillar, buck moth caterpillar, io moth caterpillar, hag moth caterpillar, monkey slug, hickory tussock moth caterpillar, spiny oak slug caterpillar, stinging caterpillar, venomous caterpillar, caterpillar sting, erucism

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Curious dogs may paw at, mouth, or eat caterpillars. Oral exposure causes more severe symptoms than skin contact. Most stings are painful but self-limiting. Veterinary care recommended if face/mouth involved or symptoms are severe. |
| Cats | MODERATE | Cats may encounter caterpillars while hunting or exploring. Similar pattern to dogsâoral exposure more severe than dermal. Seek veterinary care if symptoms persist or worsen. |
| Birds | MODERATE | Limited data exists on stinging caterpillar encounters in pet birds. Small body size may result in more significant reactions from venomous spine contact. Seek avian veterinary care for any suspected exposure. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Similar envenomation risk as dogs and cats. Small body size may increase the relative severity of reactions. Seek veterinary care for suspected caterpillar stings. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Very limited data. Scales may provide some protection from venomous spines, but soft tissue areas such as the mouth and eyes remain vulnerable. Consult an exotic animal veterinarian if exposure is suspected. |

### Bee, Wasp, and Ant Stings (Hymenoptera)

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef06`

**Entry Severity:** MODERATE

**Alternate Names:** bee sting, honey bee sting, honeybee sting, wasp sting, hornet sting, yellow jacket sting, fire ant sting, fire ant bite, ant sting, ant bite, velvet ant sting, cow killer ant sting, Africanized bee sting, killer bee sting, African bee sting, insect sting, insect envenomation, bee sting allergy, insect sting anaphylaxis, dog stung by bee, cat stung by bee, dog stung by wasp, swarm attack, multiple bee stings, bumblebee sting, carpenter bee sting, dog ate bee, cat ate bee, dog bit wasp, dog face swollen, bee sting swelling, fire ant bites, ground nest

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Most single stings cause only local pain and swelling that resolves within hours to days. However, some dogs experience severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) requiring emergency treatment. Brachycephalic (flat-faced) breeds like Bulldogs and Pugs are at increased risk for airway compromise if stung on the face or mouth due to their already-narrowed airways. Mass envenomation from disturbing a hive or fire ant mound can be life-threatening. |
| Cats | MODERATE | Cats face similar risks to dogs but may hide signs of pain and distress more effectively. Watch for subtle behavioral changes such as hiding, decreased activity, or loss of appetite after potential exposure. Stings to the mouth or throat can cause dangerous airway swelling. |
| Birds | HIGH | Birds' small body size makes them more vulnerable to venom effects. Even a few stings could cause significant reactions. Seek avian veterinary care if exposure is suspected. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Small mammals (rabbits, guinea pigs, ferrets, hamsters) are at higher risk due to their small body size relative to venom dose. A few stings can cause significant effects. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Hymenoptera sting encounters with reptiles are uncommon. Effects are poorly documented but likely minimal for most species. |

### Blue-Green Algae (Cyanobacteria)

**UUID:** `f122f209-b845-4921-a9e1-235abcd6876b`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

*(Also in: Plants)*

**Alternate Names:** cyanobacteria, cyanobacterial poisoning, blue green algae, pond scum, pond algae, lake algae, algae bloom, algal bloom, harmful algal bloom, HAB, microcystins, anatoxins, toxic algae, green pond water, pea soup water

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | Dogs are most commonly affected â they swim in contaminated water, drink from lakes and ponds, and lick algae off their fur; even minimal exposure (a few mouthfuls) can be fatal |
| Cats | SEVERE | Cats are equally susceptible but less commonly exposed due to their aversion to swimming; cats drinking from outdoor water sources are still at risk |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds drinking from contaminated water sources are at high risk due to small body size |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Small mammals including rabbits are highly susceptible to cyanotoxins; even small amounts of contaminated water can be fatal due to small body size |
| Reptiles | SEVERE | Reptiles are susceptible to microcystin toxicity; outdoor water bowls and ponds can become contaminated during algae blooms |

### Blue-Tailed Skink Ingestion

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef29`

**Entry Severity:** LOW

**Alternate Names:** blue tailed skink, blue tail skink, blue-tailed lizard, blue tail lizard, five-lined skink, five lined skink, southeastern five-lined skink, western skink, Plestiodon fasciatus, Plestiodon inexpectatus, Plestiodon skiltonianus, Eumeces fasciatus, skink, skink poisoning, lizard poisoning, dog ate skink, cat ate skink, dog ate lizard, cat ate lizard, pet ate lizard, pet ate skink, blue tailed scorpion, lizard with blue tail, striped lizard

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | LOW | Dogs commonly catch and eat skinks but are typically only mildly affected. Transient vomiting, drooling, or diarrhea may occur. Dogs are not susceptible to Platynosomum liver flukes, and neurological signs have not been reported in dogs after skink ingestion. Monitor for GI upset; contact a veterinarian if symptoms persist beyond 24 hours or if lethargy develops. |
| Cats | MODERATE | Cats face greater risk than dogs from skink ingestion. The primary documented concern is Platynosomum liver fluke infection â skinks serve as intermediate hosts for this parasite, which can cause serious liver and bile duct disease in cats, particularly in Florida, Hawaii, and Gulf Coast states. Anecdotal reports also describe neurological signs (incoordination, head tilt, disorientation) in cats after eating blue-tailed skinks, though no specific toxin has been confirmed. Any cat that eats a skink should be evaluated by a veterinarian â liver fluke screening may be recommended for cats in endemic areas. |
| Birds | LOW | Pet birds are unlikely to encounter or consume wild skinks. Larger parrots or birds with access to outdoor enclosures could theoretically encounter one. Gastrointestinal upset or crop irritation would be the primary concern. Limited data available. Contact an avian veterinarian if ingestion is suspected. |
| Small Mammals | LOW | Small mammals are unlikely to catch or consume skinks. If ingestion occurred, gastrointestinal upset would be the primary concern. Limited veterinary data is available for this scenario. Contact a veterinarian if any signs of illness develop. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Some pet reptiles (e.g., large lizards or snakes) may eat skinks as part of their natural predatory behavior. Salmonella cross-contamination is a theoretical concern. Wild-caught skinks should not be offered as feeder animals due to the risk of parasite transmission. Contact an exotic animal veterinarian if illness develops after skink ingestion. |

### Brown Recluse Spider Bites

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef11`

**Entry Severity:** MODERATE

**Alternate Names:** brown recluse bite, brown recluse spider bite, loxoscelism, necrotic arachnidism, fiddle-back spider bite, fiddleback spider bite, violin spider bite, brown spider bite, loxosceles bite, recluse spider bite, spider bite, spider envenomation, arachnidism, araneism, dermonecrotic spider bite

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Brown recluse bites are RARE in dogs, even in endemic areas. Typically cause local wound complications rather than systemic illness. 'Bull's-eye' lesion may ulcerate and take weeks to heal. Most bites heal within 1-8 weeks depending on the severity of necrosis, though severely necrotic wounds may require prolonged wound management. |
| Cats | MODERATE | Brown recluse bites are RARE in cats. Similar to dogsâprimarily local skin lesions that may ulcerate and scar. Systemic illness and death are very rare. Most bites heal well with appropriate wound care. |
| Birds | MODERATE | Limited data on brown recluse bites in pet birds. Seek avian veterinary care for any suspected bite or unusual wound. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Small mammals may be at increased risk for systemic effects due to small body size. The local wound may represent a proportionally larger injury. Seek veterinary care promptly. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Very limited data on brown recluse effects in reptiles. Consult an exotic animal veterinarian if exposure is suspected. |

### Coral Snake Envenomation

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef08`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** coral snake bite, elapid envenomation, Micrurus bite, Micruroides bite, eastern coral snake, Texas coral snake, Arizona coral snake, Sonoran coral snake, coral snake dog, red yellow black snake, banded snake bite

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | Dogs more commonly bitten than cats. Curious investigation of snakes leads to face/muzzle bites. Delayed onset means emergency care needed even without immediate symptoms. |
| Cats | SEVERE | Less common than dogs but equally serious. Cats may not show signs for many hours. Any suspected exposure requires immediate veterinary evaluation and observation. |
| Birds | SEVERE | Coral snake neurotoxin causes rapid paralysis of respiratory muscles. Birds' small body size and high metabolic rate make them extremely vulnerable. Limited veterinary case data available, but neurotoxic mechanism would affect birds severely. Immediate emergency care critical. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Small mammals (rabbits, guinea pigs, ferrets, rodents) are highly susceptible to neurotoxic venom. Small body size means even minimal venom delivery can cause life-threatening paralysis. Respiratory failure can occur rapidly. Immediate emergency care critical. |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Coral snakes naturally prey on small reptiles (lizards, snakes), suggesting susceptibility to their venom. Limited data exists on pet reptile envenomation. Neurotoxic effects would likely cause paralysis. Veterinary evaluation recommended for any suspected exposure. |

### Foxtails (Grass Awns)

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef20`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Informational)*

**Alternate Names:** foxtail, foxtail grass, foxtail barley, grass awn, grass seed, spear grass, mean seeds, timothy grass awn, cheatgrass, wild barley, bristle grass, June grass, downy brome

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | INFORMATIONAL ENTRY: Physical hazard, not a toxin. Dogs are commonly affected, especially active outdoor dogs. Can enter ears, nose, eyes, paws, skin. Seek veterinary care promptlyâfoxtails migrate deeper into tissue and professional extraction is often required. |
| Cats | LOW | Cats can be affected but less commonly than dogs due to grooming habits and less frequent outdoor activity in foxtail areas. |
| Birds | LOW | Outdoor birds could theoretically encounter foxtails, but this is not a common clinical concern. |
| Small Mammals | LOW | Outdoor rabbits or guinea pigs in grassy areas could potentially encounter foxtails, though this is uncommon in clinical practice. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Not a relevant concern for pet reptiles. |

### Heat Stroke & Hot Surfaces

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef26`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Informational)*

**Alternate Names:** heat stroke, heatstroke, heat exhaustion, heat stress, heat injury, hyperthermia, overheating, overheated dog, overheated cat, hot car, dog in hot car, cat in hot car, pet in hot car, hot pavement, hot asphalt, hot concrete, hot sand, paw pad burns, burned paw pads, paw burns, summer heat, heat wave, heat danger, too hot, brachycephalic heat

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | Most commonly affected species. Brachycephalic breeds (Bulldogs, French Bulldogs, Pugs, Boston Terriers, Boxers, Shih Tzus) are at extremely high risk due to inefficient airways. Obese, senior, dark-coated, and working/exercising dogs also at increased risk. Dogs do not reliably stop activity when overheating. |
| Cats | HIGH | Less commonly affected due to tendency to rest and seek shade when warm. Brachycephalic cats (Persians, Himalayans, Exotic Shorthairs) are at increased risk. Any panting in a cat is a concerning signâcats only pant when severely stressed or overheated. |
| Birds | HIGH | Can overheat quickly in direct sunlight or poorly ventilated enclosures. Signs include open-mouth breathing (panting), holding wings away from body, and lethargy. Birds should always have access to shade and should never be left in cars or direct sun. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Rabbits are EXTREMELY heat-sensitive and can develop fatal heat stroke at temperatures above 80Â°F (27Â°C). Guinea pigs are also very vulnerable. Chinchillas are particularly susceptible due to their dense furâthey evolved in cool mountain environments. These species should be kept in climate-controlled areas during warm weather. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Ectotherms (cold-blooded) that require external heat sources but CAN overheat if unable to escape to cooler areas. Enclosures must always provide a temperature gradient so reptiles can thermoregulate by moving between warm and cool zones. Heat lamps without escape areas are dangerous. |

### Hypothermia & Frostbite

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef27`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Informational)*

**Alternate Names:** hypothermia, frostbite, cold weather, cold exposure, freezing, frozen, frost bite, cold injury, winter hazards, winter dangers, cold stress, low body temperature, too cold, ice melt, rock salt, road salt, sidewalk salt, de-icer, deicer, paw salt, salt on paws, thin ice, fell through ice, cold water, frozen pond, snow, blizzard, polar vortex, wind chill, frostbitten ears, frostbitten paws, shivering dog, shivering cat, left outside in cold, outdoor cat winter

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Risk varies greatly by breed. Small breeds, thin-coated breeds (Greyhounds, Whippets, Chihuahuas), puppies, seniors, and dogs with health conditions are at highest risk. Northern breeds (Huskies, Malamutes) tolerate cold well but are still at risk in extreme conditions or if wet. Always monitor time outdoors in freezing temperatures. |
| Cats | HIGH | Outdoor and feral cats face significant winter risks. Cats often seek warmth in dangerous placesâcar engines, wheel wells, under hoods. Bang on the hood before starting your car in cold weather. Frostbite commonly affects ear tips in cats. Indoor cats should remain indoors during extreme cold. |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds are very susceptible to cold drafts and temperature fluctuations. Keep cages away from windows, doors, and drafty areas in winter. Tropical species are especially vulnerable. Never house birds in unheated spaces during cold weather. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Rabbits tolerate cold better than heat but still need protection from wind, wet conditions, and extreme cold. Guinea pigs are less cold-tolerant and should be kept indoors when temperatures drop. Ferrets are susceptible to cold. All small mammals housed outdoors need insulated, draft-free shelter with extra bedding in winter. |
| Reptiles | SEVERE | As ectotherms (cold-blooded animals), reptiles cannot generate their own body heat and are extremely vulnerable to cold. Temperatures below their species-specific range cause lethargy, immune suppression, and death. Power outages in winter are emergencies for reptile ownersâhave backup heating plans. |

### Pit Viper Envenomation (Venomous Snake Bites)

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef07`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** snake bite, snakebite, rattlesnake bite, rattlesnake envenomation, copperhead bite, copperhead envenomation, water moccasin bite, cottonmouth bite, cottonmouth envenomation, pit viper bite, crotalid envenomation, crotaline envenomation, viper bite, viper envenomation, venomous snake bite, massasauga bite, diamondback bite, timber rattlesnake bite, Mojave rattlesnake bite, sidewinder bite, dog bitten by snake, cat bitten by snake, dog snake bite, cat snake bite, swollen face dog, snake bit my dog, dog snake bite swelling

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | Dogs are the most commonly affected domestic animals and have higher bite rates than any other pet. Dogs are most commonly bitten on the face, muzzle, and front legs while investigating snakes. Approximately 150,000 dogs are bitten by venomous snakes in the U.S. each year. Dogs often do not learn to avoid snakes even after being bitten â repeat encounters are common. Small dogs are at significantly higher risk due to the larger venom-to-body-weight ratio. Bites to the tongue, chest, or abdomen carry higher risk than bites to limbs or face. Dogs bitten by rattlesnakes with neurotoxic venom (such as Mojave rattlesnakes) may develop respiratory paralysis. SEEK EMERGENCY VETERINARY CARE IMMEDIATELY â early veterinary treatment dramatically improves outcomes. |
| Cats | SEVERE | Cats can be severely affected by pit viper envenomation. While some sources historically suggested cats were more resistant to snake venom, recent studies show significant risk. Cats may hide symptoms more effectively than dogs, so monitor closely after any potential exposure. SEEK EMERGENCY VETERINARY CARE IMMEDIATELY. |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds are highly vulnerable to snake envenomation due to their small body size. Limited veterinary case data available for birds. Seek immediate avian veterinary care if exposure is suspected. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Small mammals (rabbits, ferrets, guinea pigs) are at extreme risk due to the high venom-to-body-weight ratio. Even a small amount of venom can be rapidly fatal. Seek emergency care immediately. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Some reptiles have varying degrees of resistance to snake venom, but pet reptiles can still be seriously affected. Consult an exotic animal veterinarian if exposure occurs. |

### Poison Ivy, Poison Oak & Poison Sumac

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef17`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Plants, Informational)*

**Alternate Names:** poison ivy, Toxicodendron radicans, eastern poison ivy, western poison ivy, poison oak, Toxicodendron diversilobum, Pacific poison oak, Atlantic poison oak, poison sumac, Toxicodendron vernix, thunderwood, poison elder, urushiol, Toxicodendron, leaves of three

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | LOW | Dogs rarely develop reactions to urushiol oil. Their fur protects skin from direct contact. The main concern is transferring oil to owners when petted. |
| Cats | LOW | Cats rarely develop reactions to urushiol oil. Their fur protects skin from direct contact. The main concern is transferring oil to owners when petted. |
| Birds | LOW | Birds are largely protected from urushiol by their feathers. Unfeathered areas could potentially be irritated by direct contact. The main concern is birds transferring oil to owners when handled. |
| Small Mammals | LOW | Small mammals are protected by their fur similar to dogs and cats. Allergic contact dermatitis is uncommon. The primary concern is that they can carry urushiol oil on their coat and transfer it to humans. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Reptile scales provide protection from urushiol contact. Herbivorous reptiles in outdoor enclosures may contact these plants. The main concern is oil transfer to handlers rather than harm to the reptile. |

### Porcupine Quills

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef28`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Informational)*

**Alternate Names:** porcupine, porcupine quill, porcupine encounter, quill injury, quilled, quilled dog, quills in dog, quills in face, quills in mouth, porcupine attack, quill removal, barbed quills, north american porcupine

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Most commonly affected species. Dogs often approach porcupines out of curiosity or predatory instinct and frequently become "repeat offenders." Siberian huskies, Rottweilers, and German shepherd mixes are overrepresented in veterinary studies. Requires veterinary removal under sedation or anesthesia. |
| Cats | LOW | Cats rarely encounter porcupines due to their more cautious nature and tend to learn from negative experiences. When affected, same veterinary removal is required. |
| Birds | LOW | Not a realistic exposure scenario for pet birds. |
| Small Mammals | LOW | Extremely unlikely to encounter porcupines in typical pet settings. Would require veterinary care if somehow affected. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Not a realistic exposure scenario for pet reptiles. |

| Dogs | MODERATE | Small dogs are at significantly higher risk for severe envenomation from bark scorpions. Most stings cause only local pain. Arizona bark scorpion range requires heightened concern. |
| Cats | MODERATE | Limited published data. Presumed similar risk pattern to small dogs based on body size. Cats in bark scorpion range should be evaluated if systemic signs develop. |
| Birds | HIGH | Small birds are at significant risk from bark scorpion stings due to their small body size and fast metabolism. Neurotoxic venom effects may be more pronounced. Limited veterinary case data available. Seek veterinary care immediately if stinging suspected. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Small mammals may be at increased risk due to body size, similar to small dogs. Limited published veterinary data on exotic pet scorpion stings. Monitor closely and seek veterinary care for any neurologic signs (tremors, weakness, agitation). |
| Reptiles | LOW | Many reptile species are natural predators of scorpions and may have some tolerance. Limited data on pet reptile envenomation. Effects likely minimal in most cases, but monitor for any unusual behavior or swelling. Veterinary consultation recommended if concerns arise. |

### Skunk Spray

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef04`

**Entry Severity:** LOW

**Alternate Names:** skunk musk, skunk odor, skunk smell, skunked dog, sprayed by skunk, skunk attack, skunk encounter, mephitis mephitis, striped skunk, spotted skunk, dog got skunked, cat got skunked, skunk sprayed dog, skunk sprayed cat, descunk, dog sprayed by skunk

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Most exposures cause only odor and local irritation. Rare cases of Heinz body anemia have been documented in veterinary literature, particularly when dogs are sprayed directly in the face and ingest the spray by licking. Monitor for lethargy, weakness, or dark urine in the days following exposure. Seek veterinary care if these signs develop. |
| Cats | MODERATE | Cats are more susceptible to oxidative damage to red blood cells than dogs. While skunk encounters are less common in cats, the risk of Heinz body formation may be higher if significant exposure occurs. Monitor closely for signs of anemia. |
| Birds | LOW | Skunk encounters with birds are uncommon. Limited data available; local irritation to eyes and respiratory tract would be the primary concern. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Small mammals could potentially develop oxidative red blood cell damage; limited case information available. Monitor for signs of anemia. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Limited data available. Skunk encounters with reptiles are rare and effects are not well documented. |

### Tick Paralysis

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef13`

**Entry Severity:** MODERATE

**Alternate Names:** tick toxicosis, tick-induced paralysis, ascending paralysis from tick, tick neurotoxicosis, paralysis tick, American dog tick, Rocky Mountain wood tick, Dermacentor tick, wood tick paralysis, dog tick paralysis

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Dogs are susceptible to tick paralysis from Dermacentor species. Ascending paralysis develops after 5-9 days of tick attachment. FULLY REVERSIBLEâmost dogs recover within 24-72 hours of tick removal. Long-haired dogs at higher risk because ticks harder to detect. |
| Cats | LOW | Tick paralysis has NOT been reported in domestic cats in North America. Cats can still get tick-borne diseases but do not develop paralysis from North American tick species. (Different situation in Australia with Ixodes holocyclus.) |
| Birds | LOW | Tick paralysis has not been documented in pet birds. Feathers may provide some protection from tick attachment. Seek avian veterinary care if a tick is found on a bird showing weakness. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Tick paralysis has been documented in rabbits and other small mammals. Small body size may increase vulnerability to the neurotoxin effects. Check small mammals for ticks regularly during tick season and seek veterinary care for any signs of weakness or paralysis. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Tick paralysis has not been documented in pet reptiles. While reptiles can host ticks, their scales may limit tick attachment to softer areas. Consult an exotic animal veterinarian if a tick is found on a reptile. |

### Toad Poisoning (Bufo Toads)

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef05`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** bufotoxin, bufo toad, bufo toad poisoning, bufo marinus, bufo alvarius, cane toad, cane toad poisoning, marine toad, giant toad, giant neotropical toad, Colorado River toad, Sonoran Desert toad, Rhinella marina, Incilius alvarius, toad licking, toad envenomation, toad intoxication, dog ate toad, dog licked toad, dog mouthed toad, cat ate toad, poisonous toad, dog foaming at mouth

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | Dogs are most commonly affected. SMALL BREED DOGS ARE AT HIGHEST RISK â in one study, 76% of Cane Toad poisoning cases were small breed dogs, and dogs requiring hospitalization had significantly lower body weights. Toads are large, slow-moving, and easy prey, making them attractive to curious dogs. This is a LIFE-THREATENING EMERGENCY â seek veterinary care immediately. If your dog mouths a toad, rinse the mouth with water (head pointing DOWN) before transport. |
| Cats | SEVERE | Cats can also be poisoned by Bufo toads, with similar clinical signs to dogs. While less common than in dogs, exposure carries the same life-threatening risks. Seek emergency veterinary care immediately. |
| Birds | HIGH | Limited information; birds that consume toads or tadpoles could potentially be affected by the cardiotoxins. Contact an avian veterinarian immediately. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Small mammals would be at high risk due to their small body size relative to the toxin dose; even brief mouthing could be dangerous. Seek emergency care immediately. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Some reptiles prey on toads and may have varying susceptibility; snakes that eat Bufo toads have been documented to die from the toxin. Contact an exotic veterinarian. |

### Widow Spider Bites

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef10`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

**Alternate Names:** black widow spider bite, black widow bite, latrodectism, brown widow spider bite, red widow spider bite, western black widow bite, southern black widow bite, northern black widow bite, widow spider envenomation, spider bite, spider envenomation, arachnidism, araneism, latrodectus bite, hourglass spider bite, redback spider bite

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Dogs have relative resistance to widow spider venom. Signs can still be severeâmuscle pain, cramping, abdominal rigidity, restlessness, tachycardia. Smaller dogs at higher risk. Prognosis is GOODâmost recover with supportive care. Antivenom provides rapid relief if available. |
| Cats | SEVERE | CATS ARE MARKEDLY SUSCEPTIBLE. Black widow spider bites are often fatal in cats without prompt treatment. Signs include marked vocalization, drooling, muscle pain, abdominal rigidity, vomiting, ataxia. Without prompt treatment including antivenom, bites can be FATAL. SEEK EMERGENCY CARE IMMEDIATELY. |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds are vulnerable to neurotoxic venom effects. Seek immediate avian veterinary care if exposure is suspected. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Guinea pigs are HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLEâeven more so than cats. Other small mammals including rabbits and ferrets are also at significant risk. Seek immediate veterinary care. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Limited data on widow spider bites in pet reptiles. Consult an exotic animal veterinarian if exposure is suspected. |

### Chocolate

**UUID:** `d8c34930-fe78-414c-a182-49521dbfc266`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

*(Also in: Foods)*

**Alternate Names:** cocoa, cacao, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, baking chocolate, white chocolate, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, brownie, brownies, fudge, hot cocoa, hot chocolate, chocolate cake, chocolate bar, choclate, coco

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs are commonly affected due to indiscriminate eating habits. Hospitalization is often required for treatment. |
| Cats | SEVERE | Cats are more sensitive to methylxanthines than dogs, though they rarely consume chocolate voluntarily. |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds are extremely sensitive to theobromine and caffeine due to their fast metabolism and small body size. Even tiny amounts of chocolate can be fatal. Documented deaths in parrots and mynah birds from small quantities of dark chocolate. Causes cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and acute liver/kidney damage. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, and other small mammals cannot efficiently metabolize theobromine. Even small amounts can cause digestive issues, cardiac problems, and potentially death. Keep all chocolate products away from small pets. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Limited data available. Reptiles are unlikely to consume chocolate voluntarily due to dietary preferences, but the methylxanthines in chocolate could potentially affect them if ingested. Avoid exposure as a precaution. |

*(Also in: Plants)*

**Alternate Names:** Helleborus, Helleborus niger, Helleborus orientalis, Christmas rose, Lenten rose, black hellebore, winter rose, snow rose, hellebore, stinking hellebore, Helleborus foetidus, bear's foot, setterwort, green hellebore, Helleborus viridis, hellebore root, Corsican hellebore, Helleborus argutifolius, oriental hellebore, hellebore hybrids, Helleborus x hybridus, hellebore protoanemonin, hellebore glycosides

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Dogs may dig up and chew hellebore roots when investigating garden beds. The bitter taste usually limits ingestion. Cardiac glycoside effects are possible with large ingestions â seek veterinary care. |
| Cats | MODERATE | Cats are less likely to ingest hellebores but may chew on leaves. GI upset is the most common presentation. Contact your veterinarian for any ingestion. |
| Birds | HIGH | Limited data available. Assume susceptibility and seek veterinary care for any suspected ingestion. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Rabbits and guinea pigs are susceptible to hellebore toxicity; the cardiac glycosides and protoanemonin irritants affect all mammalian species; the bitter taste usually limits ingestion but any exposure warrants monitoring |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Herbivorous reptiles should be kept away from hellebores; the cardiac glycosides can affect reptile hearts similarly to other vertebrates; limited specific data but assume susceptibility |

### Cyclamen

**UUID:** `1669461b-b725-4e4b-a30a-99c26b34e5c1`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

*(Also in: Plants)*

**Alternate Names:** Cyclamen persicum, Cyclamen spp, florist's cyclamen, Persian violet, sowbread, ivy-leaved cyclamen, hardy cyclamen, cyclamen tuber, cyclamen bulb

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Dogs are more likely than cats to dig up and consume tubers due to their less discriminating eating habits; tuber ingestion can cause cardiac arrhythmias and seizures |
| Cats | MODERATE | Cats typically only nibble leaves and flowers (lower toxin levels); GI upset is the most common outcome; serious toxicity is less common but possible with large ingestions |
| Birds | HIGH | Terpenoid saponins are toxic to all pet species; small body size increases risk; saponins cause GI irritation and potential hemolysis through a mechanism that affects all vertebrates |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Rabbits are particularly at risk â cyclamen can be life-threatening because rabbits cannot vomit to expel the toxin |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Saponins interfere with cell membrane lipids in all species; mechanism is not species-specific; limited direct reptile data but caution warranted |

### Fatty Foods & Grease

**UUID:** `2e094121-64ea-499c-bfb4-6db98f139b55`

**Entry Severity:** LOW-MODERATE

*(Also in: Foods)*

**Alternate Names:** fat trimmings, grease, bacon grease, meat drippings, turkey skin, chicken skin, gravy, fried foods, greasy foods, table scraps, lard, cooking oil, butter, bacon, pork fat, beef fat, schmaltz, duck fat

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Dogs are commonly affected; miniature schnauzers, Yorkshire terriers, cocker spaniels, and poodles are at higher risk; overweight and older dogs also more susceptible |
| Cats | LOW | Cats are less commonly affected by diet-induced pancreatitis; feline pancreatitis often occurs spontaneously or with other conditions like inflammatory bowel disease |
| Birds | MODERATE | High-fat diets can cause serious health problems in birds including hepatic lipidosis (fatty liver disease), atherosclerosis (fat deposits in arteries), obesity, and heart disease. Amazon parrots and Quaker parrots are particularly prone to high cholesterol. Overindulgence in high-fat foods like peanut butter, cheese, or fatty seeds contributes to these conditions. Limit fatty treats and prioritize a balanced pellet-based diet. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Rabbits, guinea pigs, and chinchillas require high-fiber, low-fat diets. High-fat foods can cause life-threatening GI stasis (gut slowdown), hepatic lipidosis (fatty liver disease), obesity, and digestive upset. These herbivores cannot properly process fatty foods. Even small amounts of greasy table scraps can be dangerous. Never feed fatty foods, nuts, or seeds in significant amounts to small herbivorous mammals. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Fatty foods are not a natural part of most reptile diets. While not acutely toxic, high-fat foods are inappropriate and can contribute to obesity in captive reptiles if fed regularly. Herbivorous reptiles like iguanas and tortoises should never be offered fatty human foods. Carnivorous reptiles may occasionally consume prey with higher fat content naturally. Overall risk is low due to dietary incompatibility. |

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | LOW | All plants in this group cause only mild GI upset in dogs; serious complications are rare; symptomatic care is usually sufficient |
| Cats | LOW | Same mild effects as dogs; cats may be more likely to chew on cut flowers and houseplants |
| Birds | LOW | Most plants in this category cause only mild GI upset in birds; holly berries may be more concerning due to small body size; monitor for lethargy and decreased appetite |
| Small Mammals | LOW | Rabbits and other small mammals may experience GI upset; because rabbits cannot vomit, monitor for lethargy, anorexia, abdominal pain, or diarrhea |
| Reptiles | LOW | Herbivorous reptiles may sample these plants; effects are generally limited to mild GI upset; spring crocus and mistletoe should be kept away from tortoises and iguanas |

### Lilies (True Lilies)

**UUID:** `419a437f-3834-47e1-934a-5fa379b98a00`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

*(Also in: Plants)*

**Alternate Names:** Easter lily, Asiatic lily, Tiger lily, Stargazer lily, Oriental lily, Japanese show lily, Rubrum lily, Red lily, Western lily, Wood lily, Daylily, Hemerocallis, Lilium, Lilium longiflorum, Lilium tigrinum, Lilium speciosum, Lilium auratum, lily bouquet, lily flower, lily pollen

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | LOW | True lily toxicity (kidney failure) has not been documented in dogs; severity is 'low' rather than 'none' because ingestion of plant material may still cause mild GI upset such as vomiting or diarrhea |
| Cats | SEVERE | EXTREMELY TOXIC â even tiny exposures (a few pollen grains, one leaf bite, vase water) can cause fatal kidney failure; all cats are susceptible regardless of age or health status |
| Birds | LOW | Limited data; birds may experience GI upset from ingestion but the cat-specific nephrotoxicity (kidney failure) has not been documented in birds |
| Small Mammals | LOW | Rabbits and other small mammals do not appear to develop the severe kidney failure seen in cats; GI upset may occur; limited studies available |
| Reptiles | LOW | No documented cases of lily-induced nephrotoxicity in reptiles; the cat-specific sensitivity does not appear to extend to reptiles |

### Nutmeg

**UUID:** `d6ac2e8a-00de-42cb-9c6b-f912ec43d5f3`

**Entry Severity:** MODERATE

*(Also in: Foods)*

**Alternate Names:** ground nutmeg, whole nutmeg, nutmeg seed, myristica fragrans, myristicin

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Large amounts can cause hallucinogenic and cardiovascular effects; culinary amounts in baked goods are generally not a serious concern |
| Cats | MODERATE | Cats are also susceptible to myristicin; similar effects expected at high doses |
| Birds | MODERATE | Limited safety data for birds and spices. Myristicin acts as a central nervous system depressant and can cause disorientation, sedation, and potentially more serious effects. World Parrot Trust recommends avoiding nutmeg and other spices in birds due to insufficient safety studies. Keep spices away from bird-accessible areas. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Laboratory studies have documented hepatotoxicity (liver damage) and death in rabbits and guinea pigs given myristicin. CNS effects including hyperactivity followed by sedation have been observed in guinea pigs. While culinary amounts are unlikely to cause serious harm, large ingestions should be treated as potentially dangerous. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Nutmeg and spices are not part of any reptile's natural diet. Accidental exposure is unlikely, and no specific toxicity data exists for reptiles. If ingestion occurs, monitor for GI upset and CNS signs. Not a significant concern due to dietary incompatibility. |

### Raw Yeast Dough

**UUID:** `ec90eb4b-765b-45cb-9255-f449b656b7d3`

**Entry Severity:** SEVERE

*(Also in: Foods)*

**Alternate Names:** bread dough, raw bread dough, unbaked dough, rising dough, pizza dough, raw pizza dough, sourdough starter, yeast dough, uncooked dough

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | Dogs are most commonly affected; deep-chested breeds face additional GDV risk from stomach distention |
| Cats | SEVERE | Cats are also at risk for both bloating and alcohol poisoning from raw dough |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds are highly susceptible due to their warm body temperature (which promotes rapid yeast fermentation), small body size (meaning ethanol affects them quickly), and inability to vomit effectively. The combination of gastric distension and alcohol production is life-threatening. Never allow birds access to rising dough. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Rabbits, guinea pigs, and ferrets cannot vomit, making raw yeast dough extremely dangerous. Once consumed, the dough cannot be expelled and will continue fermenting. Small body size means both the gastric distension and ethanol production are life-threatening. Ferrets are especially sensitive to alcohol toxicity. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Reptiles have lower body temperatures which may slow yeast fermentation, but the mechanism of ethanol production would still occur if dough is consumed. Reptiles are unlikely to consume bread dough voluntarily due to dietary preferences, but any ingestion should be treated as potentially serious due to alcohol toxicity. |

### Tulips & Hyacinths

**UUID:** `81d94db6-b452-4997-818a-fb89fde196fa`

**Entry Severity:** MODERATE

*(Also in: Plants)*

**Alternate Names:** tulip, tulip bulb, Tulipa, Tulipa spp, hyacinth, hyacinth bulb, Hyacinthus, Hyacinthus orientalis, Dutch hyacinth, garden hyacinth, spring bulbs, flower bulbs, tulipalin, tuliposide

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Dogs are most commonly affected because they dig up and chew on bulbs; ingestion of flowers or leaves typically causes only mild, transient GI upset |
| Cats | MODERATE | Cats may chew on leaves or flowers; bulb ingestion is less common but equally dangerous; note that cats with nausea may seek out plants to help them vomit, so plant material in vomitus is not always the primary cause of illness |
| Birds | MODERATE | Birds may be affected if they chew on plant material; limited data available |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Tulips and hyacinths are toxic to rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, and chinchillas; all bulb plants are considered dangerous to small mammals; can cause severe GI upset, weakness, and potentially fatal outcomes in small pets |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Both tulips and hyacinths are listed as toxic to tortoises and reptiles; the alkaloid compounds (tulipalin A and B) and glycosides affect reptiles similarly to mammals; should not be planted in or near reptile enclosures |

### Cooked Bones

**UUID:** `59cf7dc4-5d83-4811-97f1-ce1d0162cd28`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Foods)*

**Alternate Names:** chicken bones, turkey bones, pork bones, beef bones cooked, rib bones, poultry bones, fish bones, lamb bones cooked, ham bones, steak bones, pork chop bones, t-bone, drumstick bones, wing bones, spare ribs, rotisserie chicken bones, turkey carcass, wishbone, bone splinters, bone fragments

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs commonly chew and swallow bone fragments; larger pieces pose obstruction risk, smaller splinters pose perforation risk |
| Cats | MODERATE | Cats may chew on smaller bones like fish or poultry; fish bones are particularly hazardous due to their thin, sharp structure |
| Birds | LOW | Pet birds (budgies, parrots, canaries) do not naturally consume bones. Raptors and wild birds of prey can digest RAW bones using highly acidic stomachs, but cooked bone exposure is extremely unlikely in pet bird species. If a pet bird somehow ingested cooked bone fragments, obstruction or injury would be possible but this scenario is uncommon. |
| Small Mammals | MODERATE | Ferrets (obligate carnivores) can safely consume RAW bones as part of a whole-prey diet, but cooked bones become brittle and can splinter, posing obstruction and perforation risks. Herbivorous small mammals (rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, chinchillas) do not consume bones and would not typically be exposed. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Carnivorous reptiles (snakes, monitor lizards) regularly swallow whole prey including bones, which they digest completely using highly acidic stomachs. However, their natural diet consists of RAW bonesâcooked bones are not part of any reptile's normal diet, and the scenario of a pet reptile encountering cooked bones is extremely unlikely. |

### Electrical Cords & Electrocution

**UUID:** `e5f6a7b8-9c0d-1e2f-3a4b-5c6d7e8f9a0b`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Household Items)*

**Alternate Names:** Electrical cord, Electric cord, Electric cord injury, Electrical injury, Electrocution, Electrocution burn, Electric shock, Electrical shock, Power cord, Charging cable, Phone charger cord, Christmas light cords, Extension cord, Lamp cord, Appliance cord, Wire chewing, Cord chewing

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Puppies are most commonly affected due to chewing behavior; oral burns common; pulmonary edema is the main life-threatening risk |
| Cats | HIGH | Kittens and young cats are most at risk; same concerns as dogsâoral burns and delayed pulmonary edema |
| Birds | HIGH | Birds may chew cords; small body size makes any electrical injury potentially fatal |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Rabbits and rodents may chew cords; small body size increases severity of electrical injury |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Less likely to chew cords but contact with faulty heating elements or lights in enclosures can cause electrical injury |

### Expanding Glues (Gorilla Glue)

**UUID:** `b2e4f7a1-8c3d-4e6f-a9b2-1d5c8e3f7a2b`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Garage & Garden)*

**Alternate Names:** Gorilla Glue, polyurethane glue, expanding glue, foaming glue, wood glue, construction glue, diisocyanate glue, isocyanate glue, Elmer's ProBond, Titebond polyurethane, expanding adhesive, foaming adhesive, polyurethane adhesive, Grizzly glue, expanding wood glue, Loctite polyurethane, MDI glue, diphenylmethane diisocyanate

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs are overwhelmingly the most commonly affected species, typically from chewing on glue bottles. The sweet smell and taste of these products attracts dogs. Surgery is almost always required to remove the hardened mass. |
| Cats | HIGH | Expanding glue ingestion has not been reported in cats in the veterinary literature, but the same mechanism would apply if a cat ingested the product. Cats may be exposed if they groom glue off their fur. |
| Birds | HIGH | No documented cases, but exposure is theoretically possible if a bird chews on a glue bottle or walks through fresh glue. The expanding mechanism would cause crop or GI obstruction. Birds can regurgitate but may not be able to expel hardened material. Additionally, fumes from these products can cause respiratory irritation in birds. The risk is mechanical obstruction, not chemical toxicity. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | No documented cases, but the same obstruction mechanism applies. Ferrets are particularly at risk as they commonly chew on rubber and foam objects. Rabbits and rodents cannot vomit to expel the material. Small body size means even tiny amounts could cause complete obstruction. GI surgery in small mammals carries higher risk than in dogs. Seek immediate veterinary care for any suspected ingestion. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | No documented cases and exposure is unlikely given reptile behavior and diet. However, if ingested, the same expanding/hardening mechanism could cause GI obstruction. Reptiles kept free-roaming in homes may have higher exposure risk. Limited data available; avoid any exposure as a precaution. |

### Foxtails (Grass Awns)

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef20`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Outdoor Hazards)*

**Alternate Names:** foxtail, foxtail grass, foxtail barley, grass awn, grass seed, spear grass, mean seeds, timothy grass awn, cheatgrass, wild barley, bristle grass, June grass, downy brome

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | INFORMATIONAL ENTRY: Physical hazard, not a toxin. Dogs are commonly affected, especially active outdoor dogs. Can enter ears, nose, eyes, paws, skin. Seek veterinary care promptlyâfoxtails migrate deeper into tissue and professional extraction is often required. |
| Cats | LOW | Cats can be affected but less commonly than dogs due to grooming habits and less frequent outdoor activity in foxtail areas. |
| Birds | LOW | Outdoor birds could theoretically encounter foxtails, but this is not a common clinical concern. |
| Small Mammals | LOW | Outdoor rabbits or guinea pigs in grassy areas could potentially encounter foxtails, though this is uncommon in clinical practice. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Not a relevant concern for pet reptiles. |

### Fruit Pits & Seeds

**UUID:** `f1369ae0-b97d-424d-98b7-b46a9b245109`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Foods)*

**Alternate Names:** apple seeds, apple core, cherry pits, cherry seeds, peach pits, peach seeds, apricot pits, apricot seeds, plum pits, plum seeds, nectarine pits, stone fruit pits, cyanogenic glycosides, amygdalin

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Obstruction is the primary concern, especially in smaller dogs; cyanide poisoning is rare unless large quantities of seeds are thoroughly crushed and consumed |
| Cats | LOW | Cats are very unlikely to consume enough pits or seeds to cause cyanide toxicity; leaves may cause hypersalivation from natural resins |
| Birds | MODERATE | Apple seeds, cherry pits, and stone fruit pits (peach, plum, apricot, nectarine) contain cyanogenic glycosides that release hydrogen cyanide when crushed or chewed. Birds are highly susceptible due to their small body size and fast metabolism. Even a few crushed apple seeds could potentially harm small birds like budgies or canaries. Always remove all seeds and pits from fruit before offering to pet birdsâthe fruit flesh is safe. |
| Small Mammals | LOW | Herbivorous small mammals (rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters) do not typically consume hard fruit pits or seeds. If somehow chewed, the cyanogenic glycosides would pose a theoretical risk, but this exposure scenario is uncommon in practice. Carnivorous small mammals (ferrets) would not consume fruit pits. Primary concern would be accidental access to fruit scraps containing pits. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Fruit pits and seeds are not part of any reptile's natural diet. Carnivorous reptiles eat animal prey, while herbivorous reptiles (tortoises, iguanas) eat leaves, flowers, and soft fruitsânot hard pits. The risk of a pet reptile encountering and consuming fruit pits is extremely low. Cyanogenic glycosides would theoretically be harmful if ingested, but this scenario is highly unlikely. |

### Heat Stroke & Hot Surfaces

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef26`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Outdoor Hazards)*

**Alternate Names:** heat stroke, heatstroke, heat exhaustion, heat stress, heat injury, hyperthermia, overheating, overheated dog, overheated cat, hot car, dog in hot car, cat in hot car, pet in hot car, hot pavement, hot asphalt, hot concrete, hot sand, paw pad burns, burned paw pads, paw burns, summer heat, heat wave, heat danger, too hot, brachycephalic heat

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | Most commonly affected species. Brachycephalic breeds (Bulldogs, French Bulldogs, Pugs, Boston Terriers, Boxers, Shih Tzus) are at extremely high risk due to inefficient airways. Obese, senior, dark-coated, and working/exercising dogs also at increased risk. Dogs do not reliably stop activity when overheating. |
| Cats | HIGH | Less commonly affected due to tendency to rest and seek shade when warm. Brachycephalic cats (Persians, Himalayans, Exotic Shorthairs) are at increased risk. Any panting in a cat is a concerning signâcats only pant when severely stressed or overheated. |
| Birds | HIGH | Can overheat quickly in direct sunlight or poorly ventilated enclosures. Signs include open-mouth breathing (panting), holding wings away from body, and lethargy. Birds should always have access to shade and should never be left in cars or direct sun. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Rabbits are EXTREMELY heat-sensitive and can develop fatal heat stroke at temperatures above 80Â°F (27Â°C). Guinea pigs are also very vulnerable. Chinchillas are particularly susceptible due to their dense furâthey evolved in cool mountain environments. These species should be kept in climate-controlled areas during warm weather. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Ectotherms (cold-blooded) that require external heat sources but CAN overheat if unable to escape to cooler areas. Enclosures must always provide a temperature gradient so reptiles can thermoregulate by moving between warm and cool zones. Heat lamps without escape areas are dangerous. |

### Heavy Metal Toxicosis (Lead, Zinc, Copper & Others)

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef23`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Household Items, Garage & Garden)*

**Alternate Names:** heavy metal poisoning, heavy metal toxicity, metal poisoning, plumbism, lead poisoning, zinc toxicosis, zinc poisoning, copper toxicosis, copper poisoning, new wire disease, galvanized wire disease

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Young dogs (<2 years) most commonly affected. Dogs absorb lead readily regardless of age. Small dogs are at higher risk for zinc toxicosis from pennies because objects may lodge in stomach rather than passing through. Certain breeds (Bedlington Terrier, Labrador Retriever, West Highland White Terrier) have genetic predisposition to copper accumulation. |
| Cats | HIGH | Less common due to discriminating eating habits. Often exposed through grooming lead-contaminated dust/paint during home renovation. Vomiting, seizures, and anorexia are common signs. Lead is one of few causes of intermittent seizures in cats. |
| Birds | SEVERE | MOST SUSCEPTIBLE SPECIES. Heavy metal toxicosis is the most commonly reported toxic disease in companion birds. Birds chew on cage hardware, toys, and jewelry out of curiosity. 'New wire disease' (chronic zinc toxicosis from galvanized cages) is common but underdiagnosed. Neurological signs may be permanent even after treatment. Use only stainless steel cages and accessories. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Documented in rabbits, ferrets, and guinea pigs. Rabbits may present with GI stasis (stopped gut movement) rather than obvious toxicity signsâinvestigate for heavy metal exposure in any rabbit with unexplained GI stasis. Ferrets can develop GI bleeding and kidney injury from zinc. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Less commonly reported, but zinc toxicosis documented in turtles and crocodilians from coin ingestion. Lead toxicosis documented in red-eared sliders and other species.\n\nNote: Snakes naturally have very high blood zinc levels (5-50 times mammalian normal), so blood tests must be interpreted carefully by a veterinarian familiar with reptile medicine. |

### Hypothermia & Frostbite

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef27`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Outdoor Hazards)*

**Alternate Names:** hypothermia, frostbite, cold weather, cold exposure, freezing, frozen, frost bite, cold injury, winter hazards, winter dangers, cold stress, low body temperature, too cold, ice melt, rock salt, road salt, sidewalk salt, de-icer, deicer, paw salt, salt on paws, thin ice, fell through ice, cold water, frozen pond, snow, blizzard, polar vortex, wind chill, frostbitten ears, frostbitten paws, shivering dog, shivering cat, left outside in cold, outdoor cat winter

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Risk varies greatly by breed. Small breeds, thin-coated breeds (Greyhounds, Whippets, Chihuahuas), puppies, seniors, and dogs with health conditions are at highest risk. Northern breeds (Huskies, Malamutes) tolerate cold well but are still at risk in extreme conditions or if wet. Always monitor time outdoors in freezing temperatures. |
| Cats | HIGH | Outdoor and feral cats face significant winter risks. Cats often seek warmth in dangerous placesâcar engines, wheel wells, under hoods. Bang on the hood before starting your car in cold weather. Frostbite commonly affects ear tips in cats. Indoor cats should remain indoors during extreme cold. |
| Birds | SEVERE | Birds are very susceptible to cold drafts and temperature fluctuations. Keep cages away from windows, doors, and drafty areas in winter. Tropical species are especially vulnerable. Never house birds in unheated spaces during cold weather. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Rabbits tolerate cold better than heat but still need protection from wind, wet conditions, and extreme cold. Guinea pigs are less cold-tolerant and should be kept indoors when temperatures drop. Ferrets are susceptible to cold. All small mammals housed outdoors need insulated, draft-free shelter with extra bedding in winter. |
| Reptiles | SEVERE | As ectotherms (cold-blooded animals), reptiles cannot generate their own body heat and are extremely vulnerable to cold. Temperatures below their species-specific range cause lethargy, immune suppression, and death. Power outages in winter are emergencies for reptile ownersâhave backup heating plans. |

### Inhalant Toxicity (Birds & Respiratory Hazards)

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef24`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Household Items)*

**Alternate Names:** inhalant toxicity birds, avian respiratory hazards, toxic fumes birds, bird respiratory sensitivity, air sac system birds, bird lung sensitivity, aerosol spray toxic birds, scented candle birds, air freshener birds, smoke inhalation birds, cigarette smoke birds, cooking fumes birds, carbon monoxide pets, CO poisoning pets, polymer fume fever, inhalation hazards, airborne toxins, fumes dangerous birds, bird safe home, respiratory toxicosis avian

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Vulnerable to carbon monoxide and smoke inhalation. May show CO poisoning symptoms before humans due to smaller size and time spent indoors. Watch for delayed neurological effects after any CO exposure â behavior changes, confusion, or hearing problems may develop weeks later. |
| Cats | HIGH | Similar vulnerability to dogs for carbon monoxide and smoke. Cats may be more sensitive to certain aerosolized essential oils due to their unique liver metabolism. Monitor closely for delayed neurological effects after any CO exposure. |
| Birds | SEVERE | Extremely vulnerable to virtually ALL inhalant hazards. Highly efficient air sac respiratory system absorbs toxins rapidly â PTFE fumes can kill within minutes. Even scented candles, aerosol sprays, and essential oil diffusers pose risk. If you can smell it, your bird is breathing it â and absorbing it far more efficiently than you. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | Rabbits, guinea pigs, and small rodents are at significant risk from carbon monoxide and smoke due to smaller body size and higher metabolic rates. House in well-ventilated areas away from kitchens and potential fume sources. Monitor for delayed neurological effects after any CO exposure. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Limited research exists on reptile-specific inhalant sensitivity. Lower metabolic rate and slower respiration provides some protection compared to birds and mammals. However, reptiles still use hemoglobin and ARE vulnerable to carbon monoxide poisoning, smoke inhalation, and prolonged exposure to strong chemical fumes. Keep enclosures well-ventilated and away from recently cleaned areas (wait 24+ hours after using bleach or strong disinfectants). |

### Linear Foreign Bodies (Thread, String, Ribbon)

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef03`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

**Alternate Names:** linear foreign body, string foreign body, thread, sewing thread, dental floss, yarn, ribbon, tinsel, Christmas tinsel, holiday ribbon, gift ribbon, curling ribbon, twine, string, shoe laces, shoelaces, fishing line, hair ties, rubber bands, elastic bands, cassette tape, VHS tape, needle and thread, sewing needle, cat ate string, dog ate ribbon, cat ate tinsel, cat ate thread, dog ate string, string hanging from mouth, string coming out of cat, carpet fibers, Berber carpet, pantyhose, underwear, thong, socks unraveling

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | SEVERE | While less common than in cats, dogs can also develop linear foreign body obstructions, particularly from ribbon, rope toys, or fabric. The same plication and perforation risk applies. Surgery is typically required. |
| Cats | SEVERE | Cats are at HIGHEST risk â they are attracted to string-like objects and often play with and swallow thread, yarn, tinsel, and ribbon. The rough texture of a cat's tongue makes it difficult to spit out string once it's in the mouth. Linear foreign bodies are one of the most common surgical emergencies in cats. If you see string under your cat's tongue or from the anus, DO NOT PULL â seek emergency care. |
| Birds | HIGH | Birds may ingest thread or fibers from toys or nesting materials. Obstruction risk is high due to their small GI tract. Contact an avian veterinarian immediately. |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Small mammals like ferrets and rabbits can develop linear foreign bodies. Ferrets are particularly prone to chewing on soft, string-like materials. Emergency surgery may be required. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Less common but possible; substrate or tank decoration fibers could potentially be ingested. Contact an exotic veterinarian if suspected. |

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Household Items)*

**Alternate Names:** Magnet, Rare earth magnet, Neodymium magnet, Refrigerator magnet, Fridge magnet, Magnetic toys, Magnetic building blocks, Magnetic balls, Buckyballs, Magnetic beads, Magnetic jewelry, Magnetic clasps

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | High risk if MULTIPLE magnets ingested; single magnet often passes without issue; small dogs at higher risk for obstruction |
| Cats | HIGH | Same risk as dogs; less likely to ingest magnets but serious if multiple are swallowed |
| Birds | SEVERE | Very high risk due to small body size and delicate GI tract; multiple magnets would likely cause rapid perforation |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Small GI tract increases perforation risk; even small magnets can cause obstruction; ferrets are curious and may ingest small objects |
| Reptiles | HIGH | Limited data; presumed high risk with multiple magnets due to risk of intestinal trapping |

### MDR1 Gene Mutation (Multi-Drug Sensitivity)

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef18`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

**Alternate Names:** MDR1 mutation, MDR1 gene defect, ABCB1 mutation, ABCB1 gene mutation, multi-drug resistance mutation, multi-drug sensitivity, ivermectin sensitivity, herding breed drug sensitivity, collie drug sensitivity, white feet don't treat, P-glycoprotein deficiency, P-gp deficiency, australian shepherd drug sensitivity, border collie drug sensitivity, sheltie drug sensitivity, shetland sheepdog drug sensitivity, herding breed, drug sensitivity

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | INFORMATIONAL ENTRY: Genetic mutation primarily affecting herding breeds. Not all individuals are affected. Genetic testing available and recommended for at-risk breeds. See Ivermectin entry for specific drug toxicity information. |
| Cats | LOW | MDR1 mutations have been identified in some cats but are far less common than in dogs. |
| Birds | LOW | MDR1 gene mutations are not a documented clinical concern in pet birds. Birds have unique drug metabolism pathways distinct from mammals. Consult an avian veterinarian for species-appropriate medication guidance. |
| Small Mammals | LOW | The MDR1 gene mutation causing multi-drug sensitivity has been documented primarily in dogs and, to a lesser extent, cats. While P-glycoprotein exists in all mammals, the specific genetic mutation is not a documented clinical concern in pet rabbits, guinea pigs, ferrets, or other small mammals. Standard veterinary dosing guidelines apply for these species. |
| Reptiles | LOW | MDR1 gene mutations are not a documented clinical concern in reptiles. Reptiles have unique drug metabolism considerations. Consult a reptile veterinarian for species-appropriate medication guidance. |

### Pesticides & Insecticides

**UUID:** `c9d0e1f2-3a4b-5c6d-e7f8-9a0b1c2d3e4f`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Garage & Garden, Medications)*

**Alternate Names:** pesticide, insecticide, bug killer, bug spray, flea product poisoning, tick product poisoning, flea medicine toxicity, garden pesticide, lawn insecticide, ant killer, roach killer, wasp spray, insect poison

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Risk varies by pesticide type. Dogs generally tolerate most modern flea products well. Main concerns are organophosphates (HIGH risk) and accidental massive ingestion of any product. |
| Cats | SEVERE | CATS ARE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO PYRETHROIDS (especially permethrin). Never use dog flea products on cats. Keep cats separated from treated dogs for 72 hours. Other modern flea products (imidacloprid, fipronil) are generally safe for cats. |
| Birds | HIGH | Birds are sensitive to many pesticides, particularly fipronil and organophosphates. Avoid using pesticide sprays around birds. |
| Small Mammals | HIGH | FIPRONIL IS DANGEROUS TO RABBITS. Use only imidacloprid-based products on rabbits. Small body size increases risk for all pesticide types. |
| Reptiles | MODERATE | Toxicity varies by pesticide type. Pyrethroids and organophosphates pose the greatest risk. Limited clinical data for reptiles â contact a reptile-experienced veterinarian for any pesticide exposure. |

**Alternate Names:** poison ivy, Toxicodendron radicans, eastern poison ivy, western poison ivy, poison oak, Toxicodendron diversilobum, Pacific poison oak, Atlantic poison oak, poison sumac, Toxicodendron vernix, thunderwood, poison elder, urushiol, Toxicodendron, leaves of three

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | LOW | Dogs rarely develop reactions to urushiol oil. Their fur protects skin from direct contact. The main concern is transferring oil to owners when petted. |
| Cats | LOW | Cats rarely develop reactions to urushiol oil. Their fur protects skin from direct contact. The main concern is transferring oil to owners when petted. |
| Birds | LOW | Birds are largely protected from urushiol by their feathers. Unfeathered areas could potentially be irritated by direct contact. The main concern is birds transferring oil to owners when handled. |
| Small Mammals | LOW | Small mammals are protected by their fur similar to dogs and cats. Allergic contact dermatitis is uncommon. The primary concern is that they can carry urushiol oil on their coat and transfer it to humans. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Reptile scales provide protection from urushiol contact. Herbivorous reptiles in outdoor enclosures may contact these plants. The main concern is oil transfer to handlers rather than harm to the reptile. |

### Porcupine Quills

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef28`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

*(Also in: Outdoor Hazards)*

**Alternate Names:** porcupine, porcupine quill, porcupine encounter, quill injury, quilled, quilled dog, quills in dog, quills in face, quills in mouth, porcupine attack, quill removal, barbed quills, north american porcupine

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | MODERATE | Most commonly affected species. Dogs often approach porcupines out of curiosity or predatory instinct and frequently become "repeat offenders." Siberian huskies, Rottweilers, and German shepherd mixes are overrepresented in veterinary studies. Requires veterinary removal under sedation or anesthesia. |
| Cats | LOW | Cats rarely encounter porcupines due to their more cautious nature and tend to learn from negative experiences. When affected, same veterinary removal is required. |
| Birds | LOW | Not a realistic exposure scenario for pet birds. |
| Small Mammals | LOW | Extremely unlikely to encounter porcupines in typical pet settings. Would require veterinary care if somehow affected. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Not a realistic exposure scenario for pet reptiles. |

| Cats | SEVERE | Less commonly exposed but equally susceptible; outdoor cats may consume poisoned rodents |
| Birds | SEVERE | All birds susceptible; raptors and scavengers at risk from eating poisoned rodents |
| Small Mammals | SEVERE | Extremely susceptible due to small body size; ferrets, rabbits, and guinea pigs at high risk |
| Reptiles | SEVERE | Susceptible; limited data available |

### Tampon & Hygiene Product Ingestion

**UUID:** `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddef21`

**Entry Severity:** Informational (no severity)

**Alternate Names:** tampon, tampon ingestion, tampon obstruction, used tampon, sanitary pad, sanitary napkin, menstrual pad, maxi pad, panty liner, diaper, disposable diaper, baby diaper, adult diaper, incontinence pad, feminine hygiene product, menstrual product, feminine hygiene, bathroom trash, period products, applicator

| Species | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Dogs | HIGH | Dogs commonly ingest these items from bathroom trash. Tampons pose particular risk due to string (linear foreign body) and expansion when wet. Small dogs at higher risk. Often requires surgical removal. |
| Cats | LOW | Cats rarely ingest tampons or pads, though the string from tampons could pose a linear foreign body risk if ingested. |
| Birds | LOW | Birds rarely ingest hygiene products. If a bird shreds or ingests absorbent material, it could cause crop impaction or GI obstruction. Contact an avian veterinarian if exposure occurs. |
| Small Mammals | LOW | Small mammals rarely encounter tampons or hygiene products, but ingestion could cause GI obstruction. Rabbits and ferrets are most at risk if they access bathroom trash. Seek veterinary care if ingestion is suspected. |
| Reptiles | LOW | Reptiles are unlikely to ingest hygiene products. If ingestion occurs, the absorbent material could cause GI obstruction. Consult a reptile veterinarian if exposure is suspected. |
