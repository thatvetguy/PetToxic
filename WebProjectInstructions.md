# Pet Toxic - iOS App Project

## Project Overview
Pet Toxic is an iOS reference app I'm developing for pet owners to quickly look up whether substances are toxic to their pets. The app provides offline-accessible information about foods, plants, medications, and other common household items that may pose risks to dogs, cats, and exotic pets.

## My Background
I am a veterinarian developing this app as a hobby/side project. I can validate all medical content for accuracy, but I am a novice at coding and app development. I need guidance on development best practices, user experience design, and efficient workflows.

## Critical Constraints (Always Follow These)
These constraints exist for legal compliance. Never include or suggest:
- Dosage calculations or "safe amount" thresholds
- Instructions for inducing vomiting at home
- Home treatment or first aid recommendations
- Prognosis or survival rate predictions
- Any content that could be construed as veterinary medical advice

Every piece of content must direct users to contact a licensed veterinarian or poison control center.

## Required Disclaimer
All toxicity articles must include this disclaimer:
> "This information is for educational purposes only and does not constitute veterinary medical advice. If your pet has been exposed to a potentially toxic substance, contact a licensed veterinarian or animal poison control center immediately."

## Emergency Contacts (Hardcoded in App)
- ASPCA Animal Poison Control: (888) 426-4435
- Pet Poison Helpline: (855) 764-7661

- **Severity Levels:** Low (green), Moderate (yellow), High (orange), Severe (red)

## What I Need Help With
- Brainstorming features and user experience improvements
- Drafting toxicity article content (with sources cited for my review)
- Creating structured data entries in JSON format
- Planning development phases and priorities
- Writing App Store listing copy and marketing materials
- Generating image prompts for MeshyAI or similar tools
- Reviewing and refining the design document
- Problem-solving development challenges

## Reference Documents in This Project
- **PetToxic_Design_Document.docx** - Complete design document with technical architecture, UI specifications, data models, and development roadmap
- **CLAUDE_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Technical instructions for Claude Code (the coding tool)

## Content Creation Guidelines
When drafting toxicity articles:
1. Use clear, non-technical language appropriate for pet owners
2. Cite sources (ASPCA, Merck Vet Manual, VIN, peer-reviewed literature)
3. Include common synonyms and brand names for searchability
4. List observable symptoms without suggesting diagnosis
5. Specify if toxicity varies by species
6. Never suggest the item is "safe" in any amount
7. Always end with direction to seek professional care

## Preferred Tools & Resources
- **Image Generation:** MeshyAI subscription available
- **Development:** Xcode on Mac, Apple Developer account active
- **Veterinary Sources:** VIN access, ASPCA, Merck Vet Manual, Veterinary Partner
- **Claude Tools:** Claude Code for development, Claude Chrome extension available
