### Anisocoria

**Pronunciation:** _an-eye-soh-KOR-ee-ah_  
**Category:** Symptoms & Signs  

Unequal pupil sizes—one pupil larger or smaller than the other. Can indicate neurological problems, eye injury, or certain toxin effects. Some toxins cause both pupils to dilate (mydriasis) or constrict (miosis), but asymmetry suggests a focal problem and warrants immediate veterinary evaluation.

---

### Anorexia

**Pronunciation:** _an-oh-REK-see-ah_  
**Category:** Symptoms & Signs  

Loss of appetite or refusal to eat. In veterinary medicine, this simply means the pet isn't eating—it's one of the most common signs that something is wrong. Anorexia lasting more than 24 hours (or less in small pets) warrants veterinary attention.

---

### Anuria

**Pronunciation:** _an-YUR-ee-ah_

## Toxic Mechanisms

_12 terms_

### Bioavailability

**Pronunciation:** _by-oh-ah-vay-lah-BIL-ih-tee_  
**Category:** Toxic Mechanisms  

The proportion of a substance that actually reaches the bloodstream and can cause effects. Not everything ingested is fully absorbed—some passes through unchanged, some is broken down before absorption. A toxin with high bioavailability is more dangerous because more of it reaches the body. Affected by formulation, stomach contents, and other factors.

---

### Enterohepatic Recirculation

**Pronunciation:** _EN-ter-oh-heh-PAT-ik_  
**Category:** Toxic Mechanisms  

A cycle where substances excreted by the liver into bile are reabsorbed from the intestines back into the bloodstream. This prolongs the time a toxin stays in the body. Activated charcoal can interrupt this cycle by binding the substance in the gut before reabsorption. Important for some drugs and toxins.

---

### Enzyme Inhibition

**Category:** Toxic Mechanisms  

When a substance blocks or reduces the activity of an enzyme (a protein that speeds up chemical reactions in the body). This is how many toxins cause harm—for example, organophosphates inhibit acetylcholinesterase (an enzyme that breaks down a nerve signal chemical), causing nerve signals to continue uncontrolled.

---

### First-Pass Metabolism

**Category:** Toxic Mechanisms  

When a substance absorbed from the GI tract passes through the liver before reaching general circulation, and the liver metabolizes some of it. This can reduce the amount reaching the body (reducing effect) or convert a harmless substance into a toxic metabolite (increasing danger). Substances injected or inhaled bypass first-pass metabolism.

---

### Half-life

**Category:** Toxic Mechanisms  

The time it takes for half of a substance to be eliminated from the body. A toxin with a long half-life stays in the system longer, potentially causing prolonged symptoms. This affects how long monitoring and treatment may be needed.

---

### Metabolite

**Pronunciation:** _meh-TAB-oh-lite_  
**Category:** Toxic Mechanisms  

A substance produced when the body breaks down (metabolizes) something. Some toxins are harmless until the body converts them into dangerous metabolites. For example, ethylene glycol (antifreeze) itself is not the main problem—its metabolites cause kidney failure.

---

### Mitochondrial Toxicity

**Pronunciation:** _my-toh-KON-dree-al_  
**Category:** Toxic Mechanisms  

Damage to mitochondria—the 'power plants' inside cells that produce energy. When mitochondria are damaged, cells can't generate energy and may die. Certain toxins specifically target mitochondria, causing widespread organ damage. This mechanism is involved in some cases of liver failure, heart damage, and muscle breakdown from various toxins.

---

### Oxidative Damage

**Category:** Toxic Mechanisms  

Cell injury caused by reactive oxygen species (free radicals) that overwhelm the body's antioxidant defenses. Particularly affects red blood cells, leading to Heinz body formation and hemolysis. Toxins causing oxidative damage include onions, garlic, acetaminophen, naphthalene (mothballs), and zinc.

---

### Oxidative Stress

**Category:** Toxic Mechanisms  

Cellular damage caused by an imbalance between harmful reactive oxygen molecules (free radicals) and the body's ability to neutralize them. Many toxins cause harm through oxidative stress—damaging cell membranes, proteins, and DNA. Onions, garlic, zinc, and acetaminophen (in cats) all cause oxidative damage to red blood cells.

---

### Protein Binding

**Category:** Toxic Mechanisms  

When a substance attaches to proteins in the blood. Highly protein-bound toxins are harder to remove with dialysis or other treatments because only the 'free' (unbound) portion can be filtered. This affects how long a toxin stays in the body and how it distributes to tissues. NSAIDs and many other drugs are highly protein-bound.

---

### Receptor Agonist

**Pronunciation:** _AG-oh-nist_  
**Category:** Toxic Mechanisms  

A substance that binds to a receptor and activates it, triggering a response. Many drugs and toxins work this way—they mimic the body's natural signaling molecules. For example, opioids are agonists at opioid receptors, causing pain relief but also respiratory depression when overstimulated.

---

### Receptor Antagonist

**Pronunciation:** _an-TAG-oh-nist_  
**Category:** Toxic Mechanisms  

A substance that binds to a receptor and blocks it, preventing activation. Many antidotes work this way—they compete with the toxin for the receptor. For example, naloxone is an opioid antagonist that reverses opioid overdose by blocking opioid receptors. Also called a 'blocker.'

---

## Anatomy & Physiology

_18 terms_

### Bone Marrow

**Category:** Anatomy & Physiology  

Soft tissue inside bones where blood cells are produced—red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets all originate here.

### Esophagus

**Pronunciation:** _eh-SOF-ah-gus_  
**Category:** Anatomy & Physiology  

The muscular tube connecting the mouth to the stomach. Caustic substances (strong acids or bases like drain cleaners) can burn the esophagus on the way down AND potentially again if vomiting is induced—which is why inducing vomiting is contraindicated for caustic ingestions. Esophageal damage can cause strictures (narrowing) requiring long-term management.

---

### GI Tract

**Category:** Anatomy & Physiology  

Gastrointestinal tract — the digestive system including the stomach and intestines. Most ingested toxins first affect the GI tract, causing vomiting, diarrhea, drooling, or abdominal pain. "GI upset" refers to these digestive symptoms.

---

### Hemoglobin

**Pronunciation:** _HEE-moh-gloh-bin_  
**Category:** Anatomy & Physiology

---

### Nephron

**Pronunciation:** _NEF-ron_  
**Category:** Anatomy & Physiology  

The microscopic functional unit of the kidney—each kidney contains hundreds of thousands of nephrons that filter blood, remove waste, and regulate fluid balance. When nephrons are damaged by toxins (ethylene glycol, lilies, NSAIDs), kidney function declines. Unlike some organs, damaged nephrons generally cannot regenerate.

---

### Pancreas

**Pronunciation:** _PAN-kree-as_  
**Category:** Anatomy & Physiology  

An organ that produces digestive enzymes and hormones (including insulin). When inflamed (pancreatitis), digestive enzymes can leak and damage surrounding tissue. High-fat foods and certain toxins can trigger pancreatitis. Located near the stomach and small intestine. Pancreatitis causes severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and can be life-threatening.

---

### Platelets

**Pronunciation:** _PLAYT-lets_  
**Category:** Anatomy & Physiology  

Tiny blood cells that help form clots to stop bleeding. Some toxins (like certain rodenticides) interfere with platelet function or clotting factors, causing uncontrolled bleeding. Low platelet counts can lead to bruising, bloody urine or stool, and prolonged bleeding from minor injuries.

---

### Pulmonary

**Pronunciation:** _PULL-moh-nair-ee_  
**Category:** Anatomy & Physiology  

Relating to the lungs. 'Pulmonary edema' means fluid in the lungs. 'Pulmonary toxicity' means a substance harms the lungs. The lungs are essential for oxygen exchange, so pulmonary problems quickly become serious.

---

### Renal

**Pronunciation:** _REE-nal_  
**Category:** Anatomy & Physiology  

Relating to the kidneys. 'Renal failure' means the kidneys are not working properly. 'Renal toxicity' means a substance is harmful to the kidneys. The kidneys filter waste from the blood, so damage affects the whole body.

---

### Retina

**Pronunciation:** _RET-ih-nah_  
**Category:** Anatomy & Physiology  

The light-sensitive tissue lining the back of the eye that converts light into nerve signals for vision. Some toxins damage the retina directly, while others cause retinal detachment (usually from severe hypertension). Retinal damage can cause sudden blindness. The retina is examined with an ophthalmoscope.

---

### Serum

**Pronunciation:** _SEER-um_  
**Category:** Anatomy & Physiology  

The liquid portion of blood after cells and clotting factors are removed. Blood tests often measure substances in serum—such as 'serum creatinine' (kidney function) or 'serum liver enzymes.' When you see 'serum' before a test name, it refers to what's measured in this blood fluid.

---

### Spleen

**Category:** Anatomy & Physiology  

An organ that filters blood, removes old or damaged red blood cells, and stores blood cells. In Heinz body anemia and other hemolytic conditions, the spleen works overtime removing damaged red blood cells. The spleen may enlarge (splenomegaly) in response to increased workload. Located in the left side of the abdomen.

---

## Treatment Terms

_38 terms_

### 2-PAM (Pralidoxime)

**Pronunciation:** _prah-LID-ox-eem_  
**Category:** Treatment Terms  

A medication used alongside atropine for organophosphate poisoning. While atropine manages symptoms, 2-PAM actually reactivates the inhibited enzyme (acetylcholinesterase) if given early enough. Most effective within the first 24-48 hours. Not effective for carbamate poisoning. Given by injection at veterinary hospitals.

---

### Activated Charcoal

**Category:** Treatment Terms  

A specially processed charcoal given by mouth to absorb toxins in the stomach and intestines, preventing their absorption into the bloodstream. Must be given by a veterinarian — it's not effective for all toxins and can be dangerous if given incorrectly or aspirated into the lungs.

---

### Anticonvulsant

**Pronunciation:** _an-tee-kon-VUL-sant_  
**Category:** Treatment Terms  

Medication used to stop or prevent seizures. Common veterinary anticonvulsants include diazepam (Valium), phenobarbital, levetiracetam (Keppra), and propofol. Critical for managing seizures from toxins—uncontrolled seizures cause hyperthermia, brain damage, and can be fatal. Multiple drugs may be needed for severe cases.

---

### Antidote

**Pronunciation:** _AN-tih-dote_  
**Category:** Treatment Terms  

A substance that counteracts or neutralizes a specific poison. Only a few toxins have true antidotes — for example, vitamin K for anticoagulant rodenticides, or fomepizole for antifreeze. Most poisonings are treated with supportive care rather than specific antidotes.

---

### Antiemetic

**Pronunciation:** _an-tee-eh-MET-ik_

---

### IV Fluids

**Category:** Treatment Terms  

Fluids given directly into a vein (intravenous) to maintain hydration, support blood pressure, and help flush toxins from the body through the kidneys. A cornerstone of supportive care for most poisonings. The type and rate of fluids are tailored to each patient's needs.

---

### Lipid Emulsion Therapy

**Category:** Treatment Terms  

An IV treatment using fat solution to help remove certain fat-soluble toxins from the body. The fat particles absorb the toxin from tissues, reducing its effects. Used for some drug overdoses and toxicoses. Also called 'intralipid therapy' or 'ILE.'

---

### Loading Dose

**Category:** Treatment Terms  

A larger initial dose given to rapidly achieve effective blood levels, followed by smaller maintenance doses. Used when waiting for steady state would take too long. For example, Vitamin K therapy for rodenticide poisoning often starts with a loading dose to quickly restore clotting ability while maintenance doses continue protection.

---

### Maintenance Dose

**Category:** Treatment Terms  

The regular, ongoing dose given to maintain effective blood levels after a loading dose or once steady state is reached. Designed to replace the amount eliminated between doses. Vitamin K therapy for rodenticide poisoning requires maintenance dosing for weeks because the toxin persists in the body.

---

### Methylene Blue

**Category:** Treatment Terms  

A medication used to treat methemoglobinemia—it helps convert methemoglobin back to normal hemoglobin, restoring oxygen-carrying capacity. Given IV when methemoglobin levels are dangerously high. Causes blue-green discoloration of urine (normal effect). Used cautiously in cats, who are sensitive to oxidative damage.

---

### Monitoring

**Category:** Treatment Terms  

Ongoing observation and testing to track a patient's condition over time. After toxin exposure, monitoring may include checking vital signs, blood work, kidney/liver values, and watching for delayed symptoms. Some toxins require monitoring for days to weeks even if the pet initially seems fine.

---

### Muscle Relaxants

**Category:** Treatment Terms  

Medications that reduce muscle tension, spasms, or rigidity. In toxicology, commonly used to control severe tremors (methocarbamol is frequently used). Different from sedatives—muscle relaxants specifically target muscle activity while sedatives affect the brain. Often used alongside sedation for tremorgenic toxins.

---

### N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)

---

### Ocular Decontamination

**Category:** Treatment Terms  

Flushing the eyes with large amounts of water or saline to remove toxic substances. Should be done immediately for any eye exposure to chemicals, irritants, or plant saps—before even calling the vet. Use room temperature water, hold eyelids open, and flush for 15-20 minutes. Then seek veterinary care.

---

### Oxygen Therapy

**Category:** Treatment Terms  

Providing supplemental oxygen to a patient who isn't getting enough on their own. May be delivered via face mask, nasal prongs, oxygen cage, or in severe cases, mechanical ventilation. Essential for treating hypoxia from respiratory problems, methemoglobinemia, carbon monoxide poisoning, or other conditions affecting oxygen delivery.

---

### Pain Management

**Category:** Treatment Terms  

Using medications and techniques to control pain. Important in toxicology because some poisonings cause significant discomfort (caustic burns, GI irritation, tissue damage). Uncontrolled pain increases stress, slows healing, and worsens outcomes. Veterinarians use various analgesics depending on the type and severity of pain.

---

### Plasma Transfusion

**Category:** Treatment Terms  

Transfer of plasma (the liquid portion of blood containing clotting factors and proteins) from a donor. Used to replace clotting factors in coagulopathy, particularly anticoagulant rodenticide poisoning when active bleeding is present. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is the most common form used.

---

### Sedation

**Category:** Treatment Terms  

Using medications to calm a patient, reduce anxiety, or control dangerous symptoms like severe agitation or tremors. Sedation ranges from mild calming to deep unconsciousness. In toxicology, often used to control tremors, prevent injury during seizures, and reduce metabolic demand (which lowers body temperature in hyperthermia).

---

### Supportive Care

**Category:** Treatment Terms  

Treatment focused on managing symptoms and maintaining body functions while the toxin is eliminated, rather than targeting the toxin directly. May include IV fluids, anti-nausea medications, temperature regulation, and monitoring. Many poisonings have no specific antidote and rely entirely on supportive care.

---

### Symptomatic Treatment

**Category:** Treatment Terms  

Treatment focused on managing symptoms rather than addressing the underlying cause directly. When no specific antidote exists, veterinarians provide symptomatic treatment—such as anti-nausea medication for vomiting or oxygen for breathing difficulty—while the body eliminates the toxin.

---

### Thermoregulation

**Pronunciation:** _ther-moh-reg-yoo-LAY-shun_  
**Category:** Treatment Terms  

Managing body temperature—either cooling an overheated patient or warming a cold one. Critical in toxicology because many toxins cause hyperthermia (tremors, seizures generate heat) or hypothermia (CNS depression reduces heat production). Methods include cooling fans, cool IV fluids, ice packs, or warming blankets.

---

### Vitamin K Therapy

**Category:** Treatment Terms  

Treatment with Vitamin K₁ (phytonadione) for anticoagulant rodenticide poisoning. These rodenticides work by blocking Vitamin K, which is needed for blood clotting. Treatment typically requires weeks of oral Vitamin K supplementation. Over-the-counter vitamins are NOT appropriate—prescription veterinary Vitamin K₁ is required.

---

### Whole Bowel Irrigation

**Category:** Treatment Terms  

A decontamination technique using large volumes of a special electrolyte solution (polyethylene glycol) given by mouth or stomach tube to flush the entire GI tract. Used for sustained-release medications, iron, lead, or packets of drugs. Causes continuous watery diarrhea until the GI tract is cleared. Done only in veterinary hospitals.

**Category:** General  

Showing no visible signs of illness despite exposure or underlying damage. A pet may be asymptomatic immediately after toxin exposure but develop signs later (during the latent period). Some toxins cause internal damage before any outward signs appear, which is why veterinary evaluation is important even if the pet 'seems fine.'

---

### Body Weight

**Category:** General  

In toxicology, body weight is critical because toxic doses are typically calculated per kilogram (or pound) of body weight. A dose that causes mild symptoms in a 50-lb dog could be fatal to a 10-lb dog. This is why small pets (toy breeds, kittens, pocket pets) are at higher risk—the same amount of toxin is a relatively larger dose.

---

### Chronic

**Pronunciation:** _KRON-ik_  
**Category:** General  

Describing something that develops slowly over a long period, often from repeated low-level exposures. Chronic toxicosis may take weeks, months, or years to show symptoms. Examples include lead poisoning from repeated small exposures or liver damage from ongoing medication use.

---

### Clearance

**Category:** General  

The rate at which a substance is removed from the body, usually expressed as volume of blood cleared per unit time. Depends on liver metabolism, kidney excretion, and other elimination routes. Reduced clearance (from liver or kidney disease) means toxins stay in the body longer, potentially worsening effects.

---

### Clinical Signs

**Category:** General  

Observable physical changes that indicate illness—what can be seen, measured, or detected during examination. In veterinary medicine, 'clinical signs' is preferred over 'symptoms' because animals can't describe how they feel. Examples include vomiting, tremors, pale gums, and elevated heart rate.

---

### Contraindicated

**Pronunciation:** _con-trah-IN-dih-kay-ted_  
**Category:** General  

When a treatment or action should NOT be done because it could cause harm. For example, inducing vomiting is contraindicated for caustic substances (could burn twice) or petroleum products (aspiration risk). Always follow veterinary guidance rather than attempting home treatment.

---

### Decontamination Window

**Category:** General  

The limited time after ingestion when decontamination (inducing vomiting, giving activated charcoal) can be effective. Generally, emesis is most useful within 1-2 hours of ingestion before the toxin moves deeper into the GI tract or is absorbed. After this window, decontamination may be ineffective or even harmful.

---

### Dermal Exposure

**Category:** General  

Contact with a toxic substance through the skin. Some toxins can be absorbed through skin, causing local irritation or systemic (whole-body) effects. Pets may also ingest the substance when grooming contaminated fur. Bathing is often recommended to remove the substance.

---

### Dose-Dependent

**Category:** General  

When the severity of effects increases with the amount of exposure. Most toxins are dose-dependent—a tiny amount may cause mild symptoms while a large amount causes severe illness. This is why the amount ingested matters when assessing poisoning risk.

---

### Hemostasis

**Pronunciation:** _hee-moh-STAY-sis_  
**Category:** General  

The body's process of stopping bleeding through blood clot formation. Involves platelets, clotting factors, and blood vessel constriction working together. Many toxins disrupt hemostasis — anticoagulant rodenticides deplete clotting factors, while some snake venoms cause both excessive clotting and bleeding.

---

### Idiosyncratic Reaction

**Pronunciation:** _id-ee-oh-sin-KRAT-ik_  
**Category:** General  

An unpredictable, unusual reaction to a substance that doesn't follow typical dose-response patterns. Some pets may have severe reactions to substances that are normally well-tolerated, or react to very small amounts. Grapes in dogs are a classic example—some dogs are severely affected while others show no ill effects.

---

### Ingestion

**Category:** General  

Taking a substance into the body by swallowing (eating or drinking). This is the most common route of poisoning in pets. The substance then enters the digestive system where it may be absorbed into the bloodstream.

---

### Inhalation

**Category:** General  

Breathing a substance into the lungs. Inhaled toxins can cause respiratory irritation, difficulty breathing, or systemic effects after being absorbed into the bloodstream through the lungs. Birds are especially sensitive to inhaled toxins. Moving the pet to fresh air is an important first step.

---

### Latent Period

**Category:** General  

The time between exposure to a toxin and the appearance of symptoms. Some toxins cause immediate effects; others have latent periods of hours or even days. For example, anticoagulant rodenticide symptoms may not appear for 2-5 days after ingestion, and lily toxicity in cats may take 24-72 hours to show kidney damage.

---

### LD50

**Category:** General  

Lethal Dose 50%—the dose that kills 50% of test animals in laboratory studies. Used in toxicology research to compare relative toxicity of substances. NOT useful for clinical decisions because it doesn't account for individual variation, species differences, or non-lethal harm. Pet Toxic does not use LD50 values because they can mislead pet owners about 'safe' amounts.

---

### Margin of Safety

**Category:** General  

The difference between a therapeutic dose and a toxic dose. Substances with a 'narrow margin of safety' become dangerous at doses only slightly above the effective dose—these are more likely to cause accidental poisoning. Substances with a 'wide margin' are safer because toxicity requires much higher doses.

---

### NOAEL

**Pronunciation:** _NO-el_  
**Category:** General  

No Observed Adverse Effect Level—the highest dose in toxicity studies that causes no detectable harm. Used in research to establish safety margins for chemicals, medications, and food additives. Like LD50, this is a research term not useful for clinical decisions about individual pet exposures.

---

### Peak Level

**Category:** General  

The highest concentration of a substance in the blood, occurring shortly after a dose is absorbed. High peak levels can cause toxicity even if average levels are acceptable. Monitoring peak levels helps ensure they don't reach dangerous heights. The time to peak varies based on how the substance is given.

---

### Pharmacodynamics

**Pronunciation:** _far-mah-koh-dy-NAM-iks_  
**Category:** General  

The study of what a substance does TO the body—its effects on organs, receptors, and biological processes. While pharmacokinetics is 'what the body does to the drug,' pharmacodynamics is 'what the drug does to the body.' Understanding both helps predict toxicity patterns and treatment approaches.

---

### Pharmacokinetics

**Pronunciation:** _far-mah-koh-kih-NET-iks_  
**Category:** General  

The study of how the body handles a substance over time—absorption (getting in), distribution (spreading through tissues), metabolism (breaking down), and elimination (getting out). Understanding pharmacokinetics helps predict how long a toxin will remain in the body and how it will affect different organs.

---

### Prognosis

**Pronunciation:** _prog-NOH-sis_  
**Category:** General  

The expected outcome or course of a condition. A 'good prognosis' means recovery is likely with proper treatment. A 'guarded prognosis' means the outcome is uncertain. Prognosis depends on many factors including the toxin, amount, time to treatment, and the pet's overall health.

---

### Secondary Exposure

**Category:** General  

Poisoning that occurs indirectly, not from the original source. Examples include: a pet grooming toxin-contaminated fur and ingesting it, a cat eating a rodent that consumed rodenticide, or a pet licking antifreeze off another pet's paws. Secondary exposure is often overlooked but can be just as dangerous as direct exposure.

---

### Species Sensitivity

**Category:** General  

Different animal species can have vastly different reactions to the same substance. Cats lack certain liver enzymes, making them extremely sensitive to drugs safe for dogs (like permethrin). Birds have highly efficient respiratory systems, making inhaled toxins more dangerous. This is why pet toxicity information must be species-specific.

---

### Steady State

**Category:** General  

When the amount of substance entering the body equals the amount being eliminated—blood levels remain constant. Important for medications given repeatedly: it takes about 4-5 half-lives to reach steady state. In toxicology, helps predict when blood levels will peak with chronic exposure or repeated dosing.

---

### Systemic

**Pronunciation:** _sis-TEM-ik_  
**Category:** General  

Affecting the whole body, not just one area. A 'systemic toxin' is absorbed into the bloodstream and can damage multiple organs. Contrast with 'local' effects that stay at the site of contact (like skin irritation). Systemic effects are generally more serious.

---

### Threshold Dose

**Category:** General  

The minimum dose needed to produce a detectable effect. Below this threshold, no effect occurs; above it, effects appear and increase with dose. Most toxins have thresholds, but individual variation means there's no guaranteed 'safe' amount—one pet's threshold may be much lower than average.

---

### Time Since Exposure

**Category:** General  

How long ago the pet was exposed to the toxin—crucial information for treatment decisions. Recent exposure (within 1-2 hours) may allow decontamination. Longer intervals mean the toxin is likely already absorbed, shifting focus to supportive care. Always note the time of exposure (or when the pet was last seen normal) when calling for help.

---

### Toxic Dose

**Category:** General  

The amount of a substance needed to cause harmful effects. Varies based on the specific toxin, species, body size, and individual sensitivity. Veterinarians use published toxic dose ranges to assess risk, but because of individual variation, any exposure to a known toxin warrants professional evaluation.

---

### Toxicosis

**Pronunciation:** _tok-sih-KOH-sis_  
**Category:** General  

The condition of being poisoned; illness caused by exposure to a toxic substance. Often used interchangeably with 'poisoning' or 'intoxication.' The severity depends on the toxin, amount, and how quickly treatment is provided.

---

### Toxin vs Toxicant

**Category:** General  

Technically, a 'toxin' is a poison produced by a living organism (like snake venom or bacterial toxins), while a 'toxicant' is a man-made or non-biological poison (like antifreeze or medications). In everyday use, 'toxin' is often used for both. This app uses 'toxin' broadly for simplicity.

---

### Trough Level

**Category:** General  

The lowest concentration of a substance in the blood, occurring just before the next dose is given. Monitoring trough levels ensures levels don't drop too low (losing effectiveness) or indicate accumulation. For some treatments, blood is drawn at the trough to assess whether dosing is appropriate.

---

### Volume of Distribution

**Category:** General  

A measure of how widely a substance spreads throughout the body. A high volume of distribution means the substance leaves the bloodstream and accumulates in tissues—making it harder to remove with dialysis. A low volume means it stays mostly in the blood—easier to filter out. Affects treatment decisions for serious poisonings.
